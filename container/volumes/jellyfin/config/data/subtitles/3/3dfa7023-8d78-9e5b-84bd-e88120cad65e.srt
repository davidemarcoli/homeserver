1
00:00:06,416 --> 00:00:09,791
<i>Look, I didn't want to be
a half-blood.</i>

2
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:15,833
<i>Being a half-blood is dangerous.
It's scary.</i>

3
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:22,708
<i>Most of the time it gets you killed,
in painful, nasty ways.</i>

4
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:29,041
<i>If you think you might be one of us,
my advice is</i>

5
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:30,958
<i>turn away while you still can,</i>

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,458
<i>because once you know what you are...</i>

7
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:38,500
<i>they'll sense it too
and they'll come for you.</i>

8
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,750
<i>Don't say I didn't warn you.</i>

9
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:57,250
<i>My name is Percy Jackson.
I'm twelve years old.</i>

10
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,125
<i>Am I a troubled kid?</i>

11
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,041
<i>Yeah, you could say that.</i>

12
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:08,291
<i>Bad grades, bullies, all the normal stuff.</i>

13
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,375
<i>And then there's some other stuff.</i>

14
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:16,791
<i>Some stuff
that's... maybe not so normal.</i>

15
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:32,458
<i>That's me, back in second grade.
Why was I up there?</i>

16
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,041
<i>I saw something.</i>

17
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,458
<i>At least... I could have sworn
I saw something.</i>

18
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,375
<i>When you say
you something like that,</i>

19
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,333
<i>you wind up in this guy's office.</i>

20
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:52,375
<i>Good news, he's saying
there's nothing to worry about.</i>

21
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,125
<i>It's all in my imagination,</i>

22
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:58,291
<i>but if it happens again,
make sure to tell someone.</i>

23
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:03,250
<i>It happened again.</i>

24
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,625
<i>These impossible things
that felt like they walked</i>

25
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,791
<i>right out of the stories
my mom always told me.</i>

26
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:14,458
<i>So real one minute, and then the next...</i>

27
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,416
What a loser.

28
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:21,500
<i>Hey, fellas, wanna come hear
about the imaginary stuff I see?</i>

29
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:25,250
<i>It's not a thing
you wanna be saying, to anyone,</i>

30
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:26,916
<i>so I didn't.</i>

31
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,000
<i>Then... something changed.</i>

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,208
<i>I met Grover.</i>

33
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,791
<i>We had a lot in common.</i>

34
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,500
- Only he--

35
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,833
Mm-mm.

36
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:46,041
<i>And not just because we were both
at the bottom of the food chain.</i>

37
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,125
<i>And you know what?</i>

38
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,666
<i>It felt good to talk about these things
with Grover.</i>

39
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,166
<i>I could almost believe
they were imaginary.</i>

40
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,208
<i>Weird, but harmless.</i>

41
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,458
<i>Until the day that changed, too.</i>

42
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,125
<i>Until the day one of them decided
to come for me.</i>

43
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,500
{\an8}

44
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:19,666
What you see here,
they are not fictions.

45
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,916
They are not fantasies.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,833
What you see here are the truest
and deepest parts of yourselves.

47
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,208
Friends...

48
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,666
the gods...

49
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:39,541
the monsters, the heroes

50
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,833
you see here in this room

51
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:46,541
are reminders of what we are capable of.

52
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,708
Now, on your worksheets,

53
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:53,750
I want you to choose one of the subjects
you see here

54
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,000
and describe it.

55
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,833
Not just how it looks...

56
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,666
but how it makes you feel.

57
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,500
Hmm? Okay, come on.

58
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,750
<i>What do you see?</i>

59
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,333
<i>Perseus...</i>

60
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,125
that's me.

61
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,875
Mm-hmm,
that's who you're named after.

62
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,708
Is that why you named me after him?

63
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,541
Because he was a hero?

64
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,083
What makes you think he was a hero?

65
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,250
Because he kills monsters.

66
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,958
And what makes you think
that she was a monster?

67
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:45,583
Mom...

68
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,958
Not everyone
who looks like a hero is a hero,

69
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,666
and not everyone who looks
like a monster is a monster.

70
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:59,166
I named you after him
because when he was a very little boy,

71
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,166
he and his mother were placed
in a wooden chest

72
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:06,125
and cast out into the sea
by a very angry king.

73
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:12,500
Alone, afraid. And at night, his mother
would whisper in his ear,

74
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,583
"Hold fast, Perseus."

75
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:21,291
"Brave the storm that was made
to break us for we are unbreakable

76
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,166
"as long as we have each other."

77
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,583
And against all odds,

78
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:31,500
he managed to find his way
to a happy ending.

79
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,291
-  Percy?

80
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:39,708
- Mom?

81
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:44,708
- I'm right here, sweetie! Mommy's here!

82
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,333
Mr. Jackson,

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,458
you will learn to control yourself,
do you understand me?

84
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,750
- Me?
- Do you understand me?

85
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:55,583
He can't help it, Mrs. Dodds.
Percy's special.

86
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,083
- That's enough.

87
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,750
Pay them no mind.

88
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,291
When you're ready to hear

89
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,833
what the gods have in store for you,
they'll tell you.

90
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,041
I believe in you.

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,208
And I believe you'll be needing this.

92
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,333
-  Hmm?

93
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,166
Hang on to that.

94
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,458
'Tis a mighty instrument.

95
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,750
There are all sorts of schools of thought
about what drives that kind of bullying.

96
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,041
Childhood trauma,
feelings of inadequacy...

97
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,083
Look, I get that Nancy has issues,

98
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,291
I'm just getting tired
of her taking them out on me.

99
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:47,625
I feel like... maybe it's time
to do something about it.

100
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,958
You could make an appointment
to see Mr. Kane.

101
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,416
- He's really good at talking--
- I was thinking more like shoving Nancy

102
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,666
in the nearest dumpster.

103
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:55,791
- Oh.

104
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,083
- Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

105
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,208
No, if there's one thing
I know about bullies,

106
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,625
it is that you should never,
ever stand up to them.

107
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,041
That doesn't sound right.

108
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:08,541
Look...

109
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,208
I know this place is hard
for people like us.

110
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,375
But we're not gonna be here forever.

111
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,208
There are better places out there.

112
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,625
-  Oops.

113
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,750
Percy...

114
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:23,916
-  No, don't!

115
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,583
Percy pushed me!

116
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,916
-  Nancy, are you okay?
-  He just pushed Nancy!

117
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:43,291
<i>There you are.</i>

118
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,833
<i>We're not fools, Percy Jackson.</i>

119
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,916
Mrs. Dodds, you okay?

120
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:55,375
<i>It was only a matter of time
before we found you.</i>

121
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:06,708
<i>Where is it, half-blood?</i>

122
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,583
<i>Where is it?</i>

123
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,833
- Is he okay?
- Is he dead?

124
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,708
-  Give him some room, please.

125
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,208
What happened?

126
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:44,958
Where's Mrs. Dodds?

127
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,041
I didn't do anything to him!

128
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,500
- He pushed me.
- Everyone, go back to your lunches.

129
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,083
It's all right.
Percy just needs a moment, that's all.

130
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,958
I don't understand.
Didn't anyone just see that?

131
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,375
- Where's Mrs. Dodds?

132
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,916
Percy, there's no one here by that name.

133
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:11,291
All right, class, let's move along.
Let's go. Finish your lunch.

134
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:20,541
<i>The truth...
can be so very hard to determine...</i>

135
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,500
but in this case,
the truth seems very hard to deny.

136
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,666
Mr. Jackson,

137
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,208
a number of your classmates saw you
and Mr. Underwood

138
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,250
arguing with Ms. Bobofit,

139
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:38,625
yet you have offered no explanation
for how she ended up in that fountain,

140
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,541
other than, uh...

141
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,750
"I didn't touch Nancy."

142
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:51,250
Now, isn't there anything else
you'd like to say for yourself?

143
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,416
I didn't touch Nancy.

144
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,916
Okay.

145
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,500
Mr. Underwood?
Do you have anything to add?

146
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,000
Yes.

147
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:12,708
I do.

148
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,333
-  Go on.

149
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:21,541
Percy had told me earlier in the day
that he wanted to get back at Nancy

150
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,541
- for all she'd done to us.
- Grover?

151
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,375
And he isn't being truthful
about what happened at the fountain.

152
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,875
- Grover!
-  Excuse me.

153
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:32,416
Are you saying you saw
Mr. Jackson assault Ms. Bobofit?

154
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,291
Yes,

155
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I did.

156
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,791
None of this is easy.

157
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,708
Not for you,

158
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,583
not for any of us.

159
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,416
I'm very concerned about you, Percy.

160
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,750
I saw what happened at the museum.

161
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,916
I didn't touch Nancy.

162
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,958
I know you didn't.

163
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:13,666
At least, I know you think you didn't.

164
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,166
Do you want to tell me
what you think did happen?

165
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,333
- You can tell me. I might just understand.

166
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,791
You wanna bet?

167
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,208
Percy...

168
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:32,791
I've seen a lot of young people
go through this sort of thing in my time,

169
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,250
but of all of them, I suspect that...

170
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,791
you might have the most difficult journey.

171
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:43,875
I suspect you are special.

172
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,541
- So much more so than you know.
- Just... stop.

173
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,833
Okay? I don't need any more stories

174
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,541
- about how special I don't realize I am.

175
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:55,916
They aren't helping.

176
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,208
- This is my ride. I'm going home.

177
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,083
There's nothing wrong
with the plumbing in this building.

178
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,750
Maybe you should see a doctor.

179
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,458
How do you know
I'm not a doctor, huh?

180
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,333
Have you considered
eating more fruit?

181
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:30,541
Hey! I eat plenty of fruit.
Have you considered eating more fruit?

182
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,750
Oh! Hello, Percy.

183
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,333
Hey, Eddie, sorry about that.

184
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:43,083
I'm walking out, you're walking in.
I should be apologizing to you.

185
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,791
-  W-- Hell, hello.

186
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,333
Welcome home, genius.

187
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,791
Is my mom home from work?

188
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,958
Oh, is that all you got to say to me? Huh?

189
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,708
- After failing out of school?
- I didn't fail out of school.

190
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,958
Your principal called,
and that's what he said.

191
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,375
He said you got kicked out.

192
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,666
They called Mom's cell.

193
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:18,333
- You answer Mom's cell?
- I answer whatever's ringing.

194
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,791
So, what'd you get kicked out for, hmm?

195
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,750
He said I attacked a kid
on a field trip.

196
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,125
Okay.

197
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,000
All right, if... But still,
if you're gonna live under my roof,

198
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,833
- you gotta live by my rules.
-  Your roof?

199
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,791
- My mom is the only one employed here.
- Excuse me?

200
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,500
I have a job. What does it look like
I'm doing right now?

201
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,958
Losing at imaginary poker.

202
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,375
You would think that
because you're a child,

203
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,916
- and you don't understand things like--
-  Where's my mom?

204
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,125
I don't know.

205
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,875
I don't know where your mom is.
I'm not Nostradamus.

206
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,041
What are we doing, Percy? Every time!

207
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,333
Wow! Wow!

208
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,875
<i>♪ But now the current's stronger ♪</i>

209
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:15,666

210
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,041

211
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,666
-  Mom...

212
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,708
I'm really sorry. I tried this time.
You know how hard I've been trying,

213
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:29,250
but this time, it really wasn't my fault.
It really wasn't my fault.

214
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,833
<i>♪ 'Cause if rain don't pour... ♪</i>

215
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,041
I'm all wet now.

216
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,041
I'm sorry.
I'm just very glad to see you.

217
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,083
I found Gabe on the phone
with the headmaster,

218
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,625
he told me what he thinks happened
with Nancy Bobofit.

219
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,041
I told him I believe my kid.
It was a real short call.

220
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,750
Hey, all that matters
is that you're here, okay?

221
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,291
And that I had enough time...

222
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,250
to pick up your welcome home gift.

223
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:08,125
Mr. Brunner called me, too.
He told me about Grover.

224
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:10,958
Do you wanna talk about it?

225
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,833
Is there something else
you wanna talk about?

226
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:28,125
Something happened to me.
Something has been happening to me.

227
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:33,291
More than just my mind wandering
and it got worse and...

228
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,250
I'm scared.

229
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,791
- Gabe?
- Mom?

230
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,458
I don't know how anyone expects me

231
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,625
- to get any work done--
- Percy and I are leaving for Montauk.

232
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,416
I'll... I'll have the car back
by Sunday morning.

233
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,708
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Since when are you going to Montauk?

234
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:58,166
I called to reserve the place
as soon as I got off the phone with Yancy.

235
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,583
Who's Yancy?

236
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,500
The school.

237
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:03,833
Okay.

238
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:10,625
- And why exactly am I okay with this?
- Because on my way home on Sunday,

239
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,416
I'm gonna stop at D'Angelo's
and pick up sandwiches in time for tipoff,

240
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,333
but if you make this miserable,
I'm gonna go anyway

241
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:19,750
and then I'm gonna eat my sandwich
and yours while I listen to the game

242
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,416
- on the radio.
- You know I hate watching

243
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:22,958
- the Knicks alone.
- So do I!

244
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,666
W-- Make sure they put the hot peppers
on my sandwich, please?

245
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,375
- Not if you're gonna ask like that.
- I said, "Please."

246
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,000
Please, could you have them

247
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,750
- put the peppers on my sandwich?
- You got it.

248
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,458
Take your shoes off
before you get in my car.

249
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,666
You understand me?

250
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:50,500
We have a lot to talk about,
but uh, that storm out there,

251
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,708
it's getting angrier,
so let's get ahead of it.

252
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:56,458
We'll talk at the beach, okay?
Pack your bag. Let's go.

253
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,250
<i>Who are you?</i>

254
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:33,583
<i>So weak. So scared.</i>

255
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,250
<i>So sad.</i>

256
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:42,958
<i>Run away, little hero,
before you get hurt.</i>

257
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:52,833
We're here.

258
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,041
On three?

259
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:58,791
Ready?

260
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:03,125
One, two... [laughs] ...three!

261
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,791
I found the good marshmallows.
Ones that don't burn so easy.

262
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,541
I don't think it was ever
the marshmallows' fault

263
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,000
I wasn't paying attention.

264
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:54,958
Mom...

265
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,083
I need to talk to you about something.

266
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:10,291
I'm used to feeling weird.
I'm used to the world feeling weird to me.

267
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,958
Like a puzzle with half the wrong pieces.

268
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:19,750
I try to pay attention. I really try, but...

269
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,166
then I'm daydreaming. I can't help it.

270
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,250
But lately...

271
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:33,500
it hasn't felt like daydreaming.
It's felt...

272
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,708
I don't know. More real, maybe?

273
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,458
And then we were at the museum and...

274
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,166
You saw something.

275
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:55,500
Something that felt real to you,
but no one else could see?

276
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,916
What did she say to you?

277
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:17,583
She? How did you know it was a she?

278
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,500
Do you know why we come
to this cabin every year?

279
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,000
Because it's near the septic tanks,
so it's cheap.

280
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,458
Mom, how did you know
about that thing I saw?

281
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,541
We come to this place every year
because this is the place

282
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,958
I met your father.

283
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,458
My dad? What does my dad
have to do with this?

284
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,833
A long time ago, I...

285
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,291
met a man, here on the beach.

286
00:20:55,291 --> 00:21:01,375
He was wise and brave
and kind and... noble.

287
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:05,750
From the moment I first saw him,
I knew that...

288
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:11,958
that I had never met a man
like him before.

289
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:19,958
And then I realized he was unlike
any man I had ever met before...

290
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:28,583
because h... he wasn't a man at all.
He was a god.

291
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,375
You fell in love with God? Like...

292
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,041
Like-- like Jesus?

293
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:47,250
Not God. A god. Percy...

294
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,208
...the stories...

295
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:56,333
that I have told you about Greek gods
and heroes and monsters, they are real.

296
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,791
- Mom--
- In those stories, I have told you

297
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,625
about how gods and mortals

298
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,750
- would sometimes have children together...
- Mom, please, stop.

299
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,958
- ...children called demigods...
- Mom!

300
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:07,000
...and sometimes they are known
as half-bloods.

301
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:13,166
That's what the monster called me.
Mom, what's happening?

302
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,625
You are a half-blood.

303
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:19,916
And half-bloods are not safe in the world.

304
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:24,708
Once they reach a certain age
and they begin...

305
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:31,375
to understand what they are,
terrible forces are drawn to them,

306
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,291
driven to harm them before they can become
strong enough to fight back.

307
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:39,541
That is what you have been feeling.

308
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:43,625
It has always been a part of who you are,
it was always coming, I just--

309
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,916
Why are you telling me this?

310
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:47,708
Percy, I know that this
is hard to understand,

311
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,666
but you have to believe me
that this is real.

312
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:55,875
No, this is crazy. Okay? I am not a god.
There is something wrong with my brain.

313
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,291
I understand that I'm weird,
believe me, I get it,

314
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:02,083
but I'm afraid something
may be really broken now.

315
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,875
- Oh, baby, no--
- And-- and now you're telling me stories,

316
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,750
like it's gonna make it okay?

317
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:10,166
Well, I'm not a baby!
I know there's no such thing as monsters,

318
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:13,583
I know there's no such thing as gods,
and I know for certain

319
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:16,500
that there is no such things as demigods.

320
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,500
- Who's there?

321
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,416
- Mrs. Jackson? It's Grover.
- Grover?

322
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:24,291
This is a little time sensitive.
Could someone maybe open the door?

323
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:27,708
What is he doing here?
I don't wanna see him. Wait, Mom--

324
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,791
I asked to have the night, you said
we could all leave in the morning.

325
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,875
Sorry, I'm early,
but I didn't have any choice.

326
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,416
Things have changed,
this is all developing a lot faster

327
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,291
- than we anticipated.
- Early?

328
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,916
You should have asked me before you--
Whatever it is you're gonna say,

329
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:43,041
I don't wanna... hear it. Grover?

330
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:44,291
Percy.

331
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:46,500
- Okay, so something's coming...
-  Grover.

332
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,166
- ...and I know that sounds really bad...
- Grover?

333
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:49,625
...but the important thing
is not to panic.

334
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:50,833
I'm not panicking.

335
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:53,583
- Grover!
- Great! I'm also definitely not panicking.

336
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,333
I feel very good about
how we're doing so far--

337
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,666
- Grover!
- What?

338
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:59,250
Grover, why is there half a goat
in your pants?

339
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:00,375
Oh, it's...

340
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:05,166
Oh! Oh, boy, she didn't tell you about...

341
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:09,000
- You didn't tell him about me?
- You're early.

342
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,750
So the important thing is not to panic.

343
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:17,333
We'll continue this in the car.
Let's go.

344
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:27,000
My job has been to guide you
to this moment.

345
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,875
It's always an emotional rollercoaster
for a young demigod,

346
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,500
- so providing a support system is really--
- Who are you?

347
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:37,416
- I'm Grover. I'm your best friend and--
- What are you?

348
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:45,875
- I'm a satyr. And I'm your Protector.
- You're my Protector?

349
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:47,958
If I hadn't gotten you
kicked out of school,

350
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:49,541
you'd have never survived the night.

351
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,125
And what's chasing us now
would have found you there easily.

352
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:57,125
I'm sorry.

353
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:02,000
Usually, I can sense danger coming
a mile away, but this time...

354
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,291
Well, none of us saw Dodds coming.

355
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:07,125
So you knew.

356
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:10,791
That thing that Dodds turned into,
you saw it happen?

357
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:13,583
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I saw some of it.

358
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:17,500
The Mist kept her hidden even from us
until it was too late.

359
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:19,416
Mist? What's a mist?

360
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,541
The Mist. It's the veil that hides
the magical world from the human world.

361
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,875
My legs. Dodds' wings.
Even Dodds' absence,

362
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:32,500
but it isn't supposed to hide things
from me. That never happens.

363
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:34,291
Something powerful is at work here.

364
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,666
The sooner we get you to camp,
the better off you're...

365
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:41,416
- You told him about camp, right?
- Not yet, no.

366
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,875
Camp is a sanctuary
for half-bloods.

367
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:46,375
A safe space where you can learn

368
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:49,208
who you are and what the world is like
on the other side of the Mist.

369
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,000
Uh, it's not far, actually,
just a little ways past the bend up there.

370
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:55,041
Mom, what else haven't we talked about?

371
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:58,708
What else haven't you told me?

372
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:04,750
Is that the Minotaur?

373
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:08,875
Once the attacks start, they never let up.
Okay? Dodds was just the beginning.

374
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:11,833
He is next. He-- he is brutal.
He is relentless.

375
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:13,583
He is still wearing underpants.

376
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,250
The Mythomagic cards were training.

377
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:22,541
Everything has been training
for what's still ahead of you.

378
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:23,875
What's ahead of me?

379
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,166
-  Boys.
- Yeah?

380
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:27,458
-  I'm actually 24.
- Hold on, please.

381
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:47,500
Is everyone okay?

382
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,958
-  Yeah, I'm okay.
-  Okay.

383
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,041
This way!

384
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:14,041
We're here. That's the boundary.
No monsters can cross it.

385
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:17,458
Percy will be safe on the other side.

386
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:21,375
"Percy will be..."
But won't all of us be safe?

387
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:32,041
Grover, I am entrusting you
to protect my son, my only child.

388
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:35,500
Don't worry, Mrs. Jackson,
Percy will be totally safe at camp--

389
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,583
Swear it.

390
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:40,250
- What's happening?
- Swear it, Grover!

391
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:43,208
Keep him safe from anyone
or anything that comes for him,

392
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:46,666
that wants to do harm,
that looks at him the wrong way.

393
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:49,208
- Do you understand me?
- I swear!

394
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:04,000
- I gotta go now, sweetheart.
- Go? What do you mean go?

395
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,500
I can't go with you.

396
00:29:06,583 --> 00:29:09,208
- Why can't you?
-  She's human.

397
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:17,458
You're gonna need to be brave now.

398
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:22,083
Remember what I taught you.
Remember the stories I told you.

399
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:23,833
- Especially the stories, they will tell...
- No.

400
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:25,875
-  ...you everything...
- No way! Mom, I'm not leaving you!

401
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:27,958
Perseus! Listen to me.

402
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:30,666
You...

403
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:33,875
are not broken.

404
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:37,500
You are singular.

405
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:40,625
You're a miracle.

406
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:44,500
And you are my son.

407
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,333
Hold fast.

408
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,000
Brave the storm.

409
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:58,041
I love you.

410
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:05,958
- We need to move.

411
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:08,750
- Give me your coat.
- Why? What are you gonna do?

412
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:10,958
He smells half-blood,
that's what he's tracking, yeah?

413
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:13,125
- That's right.
- So if he smells you

414
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,958
in two directions at once,
maybe I can confuse him,

415
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:16,625
buy us both a little time to get away.

416
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,458
- Mom, please, don't--
-  Hey!

417
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:20,875
It'll be okay.

418
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:43,583
Go! Now!

419
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,041
- Hey! Look!

420
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:08,041
Come on. Come on.

421
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:18,666
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no--

422
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,458
- Mom!

423
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:27,291
- Mom!

424
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:56,750
- Per-- Percy! Percy, no!

425
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,041
-  Is he okay?

426
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,958
-  Alone?
-  How is that possible?

427
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:20,541
-  Yeah.
-  Yeah, he's okay.

428
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:21,916
He must be the one.

429
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:24,083
Hush, Annabeth.

430
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:28,958
He's waking. Everyone,
give him some space, please.

431
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:33,958
Welcome to camp, Percy Jackson.

432
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,250
We've been expecting you.

433
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,125
Let the games begin!

434
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:37,375
<i>It was so important I get here
'cause my father's a god.</i>

435
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:39,625
<i>So, I'm gonna go find him.</i>
