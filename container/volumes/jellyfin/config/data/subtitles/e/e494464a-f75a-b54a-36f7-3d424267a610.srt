00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,958
As their leader, much of that prosperity
must be credited to you.

180
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,958
No, we are a community.
The credit is no one person's.

181
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,375
Oh, I know that in the best of times,
the credit's shared,

182
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:38,000
but when the stores are empty,
you know where the responsibility falls.

183
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,083
The weight of the leader, I suppose.

184
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:47,583
So you… you understand
the feeling of, like, a father,

185
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,041
the need to feed your children, yes?

186
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,583
I was hoping that your land
and the people of Veldt might help

187
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:58,333
as we search for a small band
of revolutionaries hiding in this system.

188
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:03,166
Who my commander, the Regent Balisarius,
bid me find and bring to justice.

189
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,750
We are humble farmers,

190
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,291
far removed from the politics
of the Motherworld.

191
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,958
-[ax clatters]
-And still you can serve. Hmm.

192
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:15,458
The rebels we seek
have been attacking our supply ports.

193
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:19,250
Led by a woman named Devra Bloodaxe,
and her brother Darrian.

194
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:21,958
Their capture's inevitable.

195
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:25,083
However,
it's taken longer than anticipated,

196
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,958
and we found ourselves
admittedly low on stores.

197
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:32,625
And as you know or may have heard,
an army runs on its stomach.

198
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:37,500
I was thinking of a partnership,
where you supply us with food.

199
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,083
Whatever you have to spare, of course.

200
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,541
In exchange, you're compensated at…

201
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,583
Let's call it triple
the market value, shall we?

202
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,416
With that windfall, you'll be able
to buy plenty of harvesters, robots,

203
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,708
and won't have to do
this difficult work by hand.

204
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:59,416
We believe that doing the work by hand
connects us to the land

205
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,333
and honors these sacred fields
that give us life.

206
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:05,416
[Noble] There's peace of mind knowing
that you're invaluable

207
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,916
in the important mission of
rooting out enemies of the Motherworld.

208
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,041
-[Sindri] It's quite a proposal.
-[Noble] Yes.

209
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,041
[Sindri] If only we had
some surplus to offer.

210
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,000
You see, the land is rocky

211
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,916
and yields barely enough
to feed ourselves.

212
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,875
So, it is with sincere apologies
that we must decline the offer.

213
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:36,791
However, we are grateful

214
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:40,541
for the presence of such
a benevolent and powerful protector.

215
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,916
Huh.

216
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
No surplus?

217
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,583
-None at all?
-[chuckles]

218
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:51,791
[Noble] Huh.

219
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,416
But your land looks so fertile.

220
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,791
Your fields seem larger
than what your population might need.

221
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,875
Of course, I understand how it might seem.

222
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,250
Yet the scale of the planting
is evidence of the poor soil.

223
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,291
And our harsh winters
only add to the short season.

224
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,833
Now, what do you say
we share that cup of ale, eh?

225
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,041
[Noble scoffs]

226
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,291
Sorry.

227
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,333
It's just…

228
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,791
I mean, look at these beautiful people.

229
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,083
I can't imagine these glowing complexions
are nourished by a barren field.

230
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,583
[Noble chuckles]

231
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:40,833
Now… who's the man or woman among you
who oversees the harvest?

232
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,416
There must be one
whose thumb is greener than the rest.

233
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,333
[Noble chuckles]

234
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,333
Someone?

235
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:52,583
Hmm?

236
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,458
[Gunnar] Yes, sir.

237
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,958
-[Noble] Ah.
-That is me.

238
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:57,666
[Noble] Good.

239
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,708
Yes, I oversee the harvest.

240
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,458
Well, if these people trust you,
then so do I.

241
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,000
Trying to understand how I could be
so wrong about what this land could yield.

242
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,291
That's all.

243
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,541
Well, sir.

244
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:22,000
Sindri, our beloved father, is always
looking out for the welfare of our village

245
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:26,125
and so insists on keeping reserves
in case of famine or drought,

246
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,916
which, as you know,
is the responsibility of a leader.

247
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,125
[splutters] But we have been lucky
these last few seasons.

248
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,250
Our surplus has been
more than we can store.

249
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,791
So, there might be

250
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,416
a chance that we can spare a small amount.

251
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,083
Depending, of course,
on the scale of your needs.

252
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,625
Mmm. Good. Good.

253
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,000
Yeah, I mean, it's always wise
to hold some in reserve, isn't it, father?

254
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,375
Yep. Yep.

255
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,708
I am confused though.

256
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,208
Curious why you should have me believe

257
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,583
this land could barely yield enough
to feed your people.

258
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,208
-Seems that wasn't entirely true.
-[Gunnar] No, wait, wait.

259
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,708
Admiral, no one is trying to mislead you.

260
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:18,791
Sindri simply has a slightly more
conservative view on reserves than I do.

261
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,458
But we're both excited
about a possible partnership.

262
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,833
Just bear in mind
the reality of what we can supply.

263
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,666
Father, who is this exactly?

264
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,916
-Uh… My…
-[Sindri] He's of no consequence.

265
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,208
I have been empowered
by my people to speak for them.

266
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,208
This man has no authority here.

267
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,666
You would be wise to ignore him.

268
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,375
[Noble] Well… a rift.

269
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,916
It's not quite
the idyllic community I'd first seen.

270
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,625
Father, if I may

271
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:02,750
offer you some advice when dealing with
subordinates who need to be kept in place.

272
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:07,625
I find people can lose sight of the stakes
and sometimes need a gentle reminder

273
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,083
of just how those with power
deal with those without.

274
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:41,458
[Sindri] Admiral.

275
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,375
Sindri…

276
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:44,916
Please.

277
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,041
-No, I… I would never…
-It's fine.

278
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,833
[Noble sighs]

279
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:55,250
-[nervously] I…
-Let me show you what I mean.

280
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Uh…

281
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:58,916
[Sindri] Please.

282
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,083
Admiral.

283
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,250
[villagers gasp]

284
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,125
[Noble yells]

285
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,625
[Gunnar] No, stop!

286
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,333
[villagers scream]

287
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,250
[villager] No!

288
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,625
[Krypteian blade buzzes]

289
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,708
[villagers scream]

290
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,708
[she sobs]

291
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,000
[Gunnar] What did you do?

292
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,791
When can I expect my harvest?

293
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,291
[shuddering] Oh…

294
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,375
I don't…

295
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,125
I said, tell me, partner,
when I can expect my harvest.

296
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,833
Uh… Um… [splutters]

297
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,208
-Nine… nine weeks.
-Very well.

298
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,708
In ten weeks, I shall return.

299
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:51,333
You shall have
my 10,000 bushels prepared for my ship.

300
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:55,375
Twelve… We barely produce 12,000 bushels.

301
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:56,750
We'll starve to death.

302
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,375
I don't understand what you want.

303
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,125
Well, it's simple.

304
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,625
I want everything.

305
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,416
[dropship engines blast]

306
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:23,666
All right, listen up.

307
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,583
I need all of this gear moved
to this big stone building.

308
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,208
That should suit us for now.

309
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:32,000
Marcus, you're gonna help me evict
the current residents from our new home.

310
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:32,958
Copy?

311
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,625
Copy you, boss.

312
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,125
Copy you.

313
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,125
Hello, everyone.

314
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,250
-[lever clanks]
-[air hissing]

315
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:59,250
I am JC-1435
of the Mechanicas Militarium,

316
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:00,583
defender of the King.

317
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:03,791
Correction, of the slain King.

318
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,708
It is my honor to serve.

319
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:07,833
I'm Private Aris.

320
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:12,375
We're moving supplies to that building,
if you wouldn't mind lending a hand.

321
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,375
Thank you, Private Aris.

322
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:17,333
That falls perfectly into my protocols.

323
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:20,958
[Marcus] I'm talking to you,
you dirty drain turtle. Come here.

324
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:23,000
[shouts] The hell you waiting for?
Get out, man!

325
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:25,958
[shouts aggressively]

326
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:30,500
[whistles]

327
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,708
[Marcus] Mmm.

328
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,125
Thank you.

329
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:58,375
[ladle clatters]

330
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:04,291
Now, what in the name of the old gods
are you looking at?

331
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:08,166
I'm sorry, I was just waiting to see
if you needed some more water.

332
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,333
Some more water?

333
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:11,208
[shouts aggressively]

334
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,291
[makes kissing sound]

335
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:17,708
That's how I like 'em.
Young, strong enough to put up a fight.

336
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,625
[commander chuckles]

337
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:22,875
-Boss.
-[commander] Hmm?

338
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:24,375
Look, they left us a Jimmy.

339
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:27,625
It's a Jimmy, man.

340
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:29,416
[howling]

341
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:32,541
I didn't know we had any of those left.

342
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:41,958
All right, careful. The ground's uneven
till you get to the bridge.

343
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:45,833
Thank you, Private Aris,
but I believe I can manage.

344
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:47,541
[Marcus] They won't fight anymore.

345
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,750
What do you mean they won't fight anymore?

346
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,666
It's something in their programming.

347
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,333
Once the King was killed,

348
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:56,958
they just laid down their weapons
and refused to fight.

349
00:24:57,041 --> 00:25:00,875
Just watch, no matter what I do,
he doesn't fight back.

350
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:05,708
-[plasma ricochets]
-[uraki whinnying]

351
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:07,000
[Marcus] Hey!

352
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:09,208
Careful with that stuff,
you stupid machine.

353
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,791
I'll turn you into scrap, you dumbshit.
You hear me?

354
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:14,208
You're not hearing me.

355
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:16,500
[gun fires]

356
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:20,458
[Aris] Hey! Stop.

357
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:24,541
What if I shoot you instead, huh?

358
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:28,416
I could kill you right now
and no one would care.

359
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,875
-Would they?
-[commander] That's enough.

360
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:33,333
What do you say? Wanna die?

361
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:34,500
What's it, huh?

362
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:35,416
Come on, boy.

363
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:38,333
[gun powers down]

364
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:39,458
I said, enough.

365
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:49,833
Get these crates
into that house now, Private.

366
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:51,416
Yes, boss.

367
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:01,000
Are you malfunctioning?

368
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,250
No, sir.

369
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:08,250
Get up. Go to the river. Clean yourself.

370
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:13,041
The rest of you, stop staring.

371
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:14,291
Get back to work.

372
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:15,958
[Marcus] Get back to work, assholes.

373
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,041
[commander] That includes you, Marcus.

374
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:19,500
[soldier 1] You got it?

375
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:21,708
[crate clangs]

376
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,166
[Marcus grunts]

377
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,500
[Sam] Excuse me.

378
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,291
[JC-1435] Thank you. That is kind.

379
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,708
-You're a soldier?
-Long ago.

380
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:00,791
Do you mind? I'm Sam.

381
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:01,875
[JC-1435] Please.

382
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:13,708
Tell me, Sam.
Do you know the story of our slain King

383
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:17,666
and his beautiful daughter,
the Princess Issa?

384
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,791
I don't.

385
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:22,208
Well, you remind me of her.

386
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,125
In myth, she was called
the Chalice or the Redeemer.

387
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:30,041
She was <i>pueri salvatoris.</i>

388
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:32,291
And even before she was born,

389
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:35,333
I and my brothers
pledged everything we were,

390
00:27:35,416 --> 00:27:38,500
everything that dwells
inside this metal skin,

391
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:40,166
to fight in her name.

392
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:45,666
So when word reached us
on some distant battlefield

393
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:50,291
that she, as prophesied, had been born
of flesh and blood into our world,

394
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:54,166
I felt a great warmth for the universe

395
00:27:54,958 --> 00:28:00,041
and trusted that she was to usher in
a new age of peace and compassion.

396
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:03,375
And bring us home.

397
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:07,208
She was magic.

398
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:10,791
[JC-1435] Ah, yes.
She was more than magic.

399
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,208
On the day of her coronation,

400
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:18,625
she, along with
our honored King and Queen,

401
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:23,791
were assassinated in cold blood
by those they trusted most.

402
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:29,416
I fear we lost some measure
of our honor since that betrayal.

403
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:34,583
I'm afraid our compassion, our kindness,

404
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:36,458
our very joy,

405
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:40,916
died with that young girl.

406
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:51,791
I think it lives in you.

407
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:34,958
This is your fault, Gunnar!

408
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:37,041
I didn't know that he would kill them.

409
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,750
Doesn't matter. He's dead now.

410
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:42,125
[villager 1] What about the soldiers?
Next, it's gonna be the other house.

411
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:44,416
-[villager 2] I don't know.
-Stop, please.

412
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,791
How about we bring in the crop
and we fall on their mercy?

413
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:48,791
[villager 3] Yeah.

414
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:51,458
We make ourselves invaluable.
They wouldn't be able to kill us.

415
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:53,833
-They would need us.
-He's right.

416
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:58,791
Farming, that is our skill
that we can do, that they cannot.

417
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:02,125
If we show them how good we are,
they will be forced to spare us.

418
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:03,541
-Yes.
-Yes. Yeah.

419
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:06,916
-Do we agree? Our work fights for us.
-[all] Yes!

420
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,916
-Our work fights for us. Yes?
-[villagers] Yes!

421
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:11,791
[Den] It's settled then.

422
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:14,125
-We show them how valuable we are.
-[villager 3] Okay.

423
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:16,333
[Den] And when we have fulfilled
our side of the deal,

424
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:19,333
they will be forced to rethink
how much food they leave us.

425
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:20,416
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

426
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:24,333
We can appeal to those gentlemen
in the granary, appeal to their humanity.

427
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:25,750
-[villager 3] Yeah.
-Good.

428
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:36,833
So… it's running.

429
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,833
Would've thought
you'd have had enough of that.

430
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:45,708
You heard them. They're delusional.

431
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:49,416
They think those soldiers will show mercy
even after what they did to Sindri,

432
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:51,291
right in front of them.

433
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,166
When I found you
in the wreckage of that ship,

434
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:01,666
I considered leaving you.

435
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:04,750
I was afraid
you could bring trouble to us.

436
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:10,333
But do I for a moment
regret bringing you into our lives?

437
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:11,833
I do not.

438
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:14,291
You've become a part of us.

439
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:18,625
And yet, now you leave
when we need you most.

440
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:21,416
When your people need you.

441
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:27,375
I can't.

442
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:29,458
You mean, you won't?

443
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:32,375
This place is already lost.

444
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,208
But what if that could change?

445
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:37,375
What if we <i>did </i>fight,
not only us, but others?

446
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:39,625
-Who else would come here and fight?
-Others! Others!

447
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:43,708
Others that have reason to hate
all that the Motherworld represents.

448
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:49,083
Kora, you know this universe
better than I.

449
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:54,916
What if you could find
the warriors that Noble seeks?

450
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,500
The outlaws to fight alongside us?

451
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,375
If I find warriors to fight for Veldt,
I give the village hope.

452
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:05,583
If I give them hope,
they fight and surely lose.

453
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,666
I won't have that blood on my hands.

454
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:12,333
Nor will I throw my life away
the same as the rest of you.

455
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:15,541
[melancholy violin music plays]

456
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:39,791
Check this.

457
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,583
Hey, water girl!

[grunts]

459
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:45,166
-[Marcus] Come here.
-[Sam] What is it?

460
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,125
Did you need some more water?

461
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:49,916
Just a… a little water.

462
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:51,333
Stop it!

463
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:53,041
[bucket clatters]

464
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:54,208
[Marcus] Or what?

465
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:58,458
-[Marcus yells]
-[Sam shouting] Help! Help!

466
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:00,250
Please, help!

467
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:02,375
[Sam and Marcus grunt]

468
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:03,791
[Sam screams]

469
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:05,166
Help!

470
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,583
-Shut up!
-Get off me!

471
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:08,291
-Help me!
-[Marcus] Shut up!

472
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:12,958
[Sam] No. Please!

473
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:17,708
-[Marcus] Shut up.
-Someone help me, please! Please, help!

474
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:19,916
-Help me! Get off of me!
-[Marcus] Shut up!

475
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,541
Get off me! [screaming]

476
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,000
[Sam grunts]

477
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,041
[Aris] Don't!

478
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:27,833
Attaboy. What do you have in mind?

479
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:40,166
[Aris coughs]

480
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:52,083
I'm gonna tie you to a post
and make you watch every day

481
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:54,708
as she turns from a farm girl to a whore.

482
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:55,833

484
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:00,541
Marcus, my good man…

485
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:07,541
This all sounds nice,

486
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:10,125
but you're not gonna do anything.

487
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:15,291
Not until I split this sapling myself.

488
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:18,416
[Sam struggles]

489
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:23,708
Then you may have her.

490
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:26,666
Then you can all have her.

491
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,166

-[soldiers laugh]

492

-Get off her!

[shushing]

495
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:36,458
[Kora] Stop!

496

[Kora pants]

497
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:47,208
Stop.

498
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:52,208
Dessert. [chuckles maliciously]
Perfect.

499
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,375
Definitely get her.

Please.

512
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,708
[commander] I will kill her.

513
00:36:46,416 --> 00:36:48,000
Is that what you want? Huh?

514
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:49,416
Huh?

515
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,791
Ah, look who decided to join us.

516
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:56,000
Kill her. Kill them both.

00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:15,583
What are you waiting for?
I gave you an order.

520
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:16,500
Kill this b…

I'm looking for information.

701
00:51:05,791 --> 00:51:11,083
Has anyone here heard of General Titus
or know where he might be?

702
00:51:13,583 --> 00:51:15,250
[indistinct chatter]

703
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:18,208
[creature squeals, chitters]

704
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:21,375
Of course, General Titus.

705
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:28,750
Crazy bastard. Turned his own men
on the Motherworld's forces [grunts]

706
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:30,875
at the Battle of Sarawu.

707
00:51:32,208 --> 00:51:34,166
Do you know of his location?

708
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:38,375
Last I heard,
he was fighting in the coliseum at Pollux.

709
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:41,291
[growls]

710
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:43,041
[creature chitters]

711
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:45,375
I'd be careful if I were you, little miss.

712
00:51:45,458 --> 00:51:49,250
Last hunter who went looking for him
ended up with his head on a pike

713
00:51:50,625 --> 00:51:52,583
outside the coliseum entrance

714
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:56,416
as a warning not to bother him.

715
00:51:57,583 --> 00:52:00,333
[gasps]

716
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:03,250
[groans]

717
00:52:03,833 --> 00:52:05,208
So, he's on Pollux.

718
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:08,916
-That's your plan?
-That's my plan.

719
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:12,458
What?

720
00:52:12,541 --> 00:52:14,625
Guess we need to
find a ship to take us to Pollux.

721
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:17,250
You're catching on.

722
00:52:19,833 --> 00:52:21,958
Hey! Bitch!

723
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:24,250
[chuckles]

724
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:25,750
Oh.

725
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:27,958
You should have killed me.

726
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:29,458
Now you're gonna die.

727
00:52:31,375 --> 00:52:36,625
I'm gonna give you one chance
to just turn and walk away.

728
00:52:36,708 --> 00:52:38,000
Uh-oh.

729
00:52:38,083 --> 00:52:42,541
Are you gonna give all of us one chance?

730
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:45,208

[growls]

739
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:34,583
Impressive.

740
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:41,750
[Kora] Were those Hawkshaws that paid you
working for the Motherworld?

741
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:44,291
-I don't like bounty hunters.
-[man] I didn't ask.

742
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:47,083
And to be clear,
I don't like bounty hunters either.

743
00:54:47,166 --> 00:54:48,458
[Kora] So you're a gun for hire?

744
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:50,583
No. That's not my thing.

745
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,541
I'm more of an opportunist, you might say.

746
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,875
A real hero, huh?

747
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:58,416
[door opens]

748
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,500
Wait.

749
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:04,541
Look. I heard you in there,

750
00:55:04,625 --> 00:55:06,041
trying to get to Pollux.

751
00:55:07,125 --> 00:55:08,041
I could help you.

752
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:11,000
Oh, understand, we're just simple farmers.

753
00:55:11,083 --> 00:55:14,166
We're searching for soldiers
for a fight against the Motherworld.

754
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:18,375
We have some money,
but this is not the one you get rich on.

755
00:55:18,458 --> 00:55:20,041
Aye, I understand.

756
00:55:21,083 --> 00:55:23,125
Still, pay me what it's worth to you.

757
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Soldiers for a fight
against the Motherworld?

758
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:30,875
Well, my name's Kai.

759
00:55:30,958 --> 00:55:33,333
Come on, my ship's down at port.

760

[dramatic music builds]

765
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:10,125
Right. Setting course for Pollux.

[buttons click]

767
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:13,250
[Kai] I need to stop on Neu-Wodi first.

768
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:15,583
You know, there's a rancher there.

769
00:56:15,666 --> 00:56:17,583
He has a man
that might just work out for you.

770
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,166
Is he worth our time?

771
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,250
Because we can't afford to waste any.

772
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:23,291
I think you'll like him.

773
00:56:24,333 --> 00:56:25,708
You ever been off-planet?

774
00:56:25,791 --> 00:56:26,916
No.

775
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,666
What did you do on the farm?

776
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:33,041
I oversee the harvest, and planting,
cataloguing seeds, and making sure that…

777
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:35,125
That sounds great.
You might want to hold on.

778

Oh, Cassius, it's you. Good.

793
00:57:35,833 --> 00:57:38,291
[Cassius] We received a communiqué
from the Hawkshaws.

794
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:41,208
They're requesting to rendezvous with us.

795
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:44,500
Apparently they've captured a creature

796
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:47,666
that has important information
about the insurgents,

797
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:50,000
Devra Bloodaxe and her brother.

798
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:53,000
Bloodaxe? Huh.

799
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:55,458
-Well, that…
-[creatures chitter]

800
00:57:55,541 --> 00:57:56,875
That's excellent, Cassius.

801
00:57:57,916 --> 00:57:59,583
Inform me when they arrive.

802
00:57:59,666 --> 00:58:01,083
-[Cassius] Yes, sir.
-Hey.

[ship engine sputters]

804
00:58:20,625 --> 00:58:25,166
Well, if it isn't
the bastard from Saaldorun.

[man laughs]

806
00:58:27,541 --> 00:58:30,875
-What brings you all the way out here?
-I missed your smiling face.

807
00:58:30,958 --> 00:58:32,500
[man laughs]

808
00:58:32,583 --> 00:58:34,500
You still got
that man chained in the back?

809
00:58:34,583 --> 00:58:36,875
Tarak? Yeah,
he's working off his debt to me.

810
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:40,500
Another couple dozen seasons,
we should be square.

811
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:41,666
What's it to you?

812
00:58:42,166 --> 00:58:43,541
You mind if we talk to him?

813
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:46,500
Could be a deal in it for ya.

814
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:48,041
[bennu screeches]

815
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:50,666
Well, if there's money to be made…

816
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,708
Hey!

817
00:58:55,958 --> 00:58:57,625
Hey! Tarak!

[metal sizzling]

819
00:59:00,208 --> 00:59:02,083
[man] These people want to talk to you.

820
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:07,250
-What got that chain on your leg?
-[Tarak] A long road of mistakes.

821
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:10,958
But if you're here to accuse me
of crimes against the Motherworld,

822
00:59:11,458 --> 00:59:13,291
I'm guilty as charged.
Take it up with him.

823
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:15,333
No. That's not why we're here.

824
00:59:17,666 --> 00:59:21,375
We're here from a small village,
and we're looking to hire some fighters

825
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:24,791
to train and protect us
against a force from the Motherworld.

826
00:59:25,958 --> 00:59:28,041
-I'm no friend of the Realm.
-Okay.

827
00:59:28,125 --> 00:59:29,625
[Tarak] That's well-known.

828
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:31,625
And I'd gladly fight with you,

829
00:59:31,708 --> 00:59:34,375
but… I have a debt on my name,

830
00:59:34,458 --> 00:59:35,791
and I honor my debts.

831
00:59:37,125 --> 00:59:38,416
What's he owe you?

832
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:40,666
[man] Uh…

833
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:44,708
300,000 Darams ought to cover
any inconvenience I've suffered.

834
00:59:44,791 --> 00:59:46,208
Oh, ya bollocks.

835
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,958
We don't have that kind of money.

836
00:59:48,041 --> 00:59:49,000
No money.

837
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:54,750
Well, I do love to gamble.

838
00:59:55,333 --> 00:59:56,541
Here we go.

839
00:59:56,625 --> 00:59:57,541
What's the bet?

840
00:59:58,833 --> 01:00:02,500
If Tarak can break that creature
out there, his debts are squared with me.

841
01:00:02,583 --> 01:00:04,208
[chain rattles]

842
01:00:04,291 --> 01:00:05,541
[man] But if he don't ride him,

843
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:09,208
you all get a chain and a shackle.

844
01:00:09,291 --> 01:00:10,583
That's the deal.

845
01:00:10,666 --> 01:00:11,875
[man] Grab it tighter!

Watch its tail!

01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,416
Can you ride him?

01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:23,250
[bennu screeches]

850
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,291
Yeah… I can ride him.

[roars]

852
01:00:33,541 --> 01:00:36,291
[man] Yank it hard!
Don't let him fight you like that!

01:00:36,375 --> 01:00:38,166
[bennu screeches]

854
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:40,083
Pull!

855
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:51,000
[roars]

856
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:54,750
Drop your leads.

857
01:00:54,833 --> 01:00:56,458
She'll tear you apart.

858
01:00:56,541 --> 01:00:59,416
Drop your leads and clear out now.

859
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,750
Suit yourself. Drop them.

860
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:05,833
[bennu roars]

[bennu growls]

862
01:01:16,791 --> 01:01:18,708
[in Samandrait] I'm not going to hurt you.

01:01:18,791 --> 01:01:20,291
[bennu screeches]

864
01:01:22,541 --> 01:01:25,583
You're far from home and so am I.

865
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:28,875
See, you and I…

866
01:01:30,166 --> 01:01:31,333
…we are alike.

867
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:35,833
We've been hurt. Betrayed.

868
01:01:35,916 --> 01:01:37,458
Our trust has been broken.

869
01:01:37,541 --> 01:01:39,750
[man inhales sharply, exhales]

870
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:46,666
We both know fear.

871
01:01:47,416 --> 01:01:49,166
Yet, the biggest fear we both face…

872
01:01:58,375 --> 01:02:00,875
…is the fear of ourselves.

873
01:02:02,208 --> 01:02:04,833
-[bennu growls softly]
-[gentle music plays]

874
01:02:05,875 --> 01:02:06,875
[in English] That's it.

875
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:12,666
[in Samandrait]
Let's show them we're not afraid.

876
01:02:13,291 --> 01:02:18,250
Let's show them we're more
than the shackles that bind us.

01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,416
-I think your friendship makes her safer.
<i>-That our friendship made her safer.</i>

1057
01:18:16,916 --> 01:18:18,541
<i>I believed in her.</i>

1058
01:18:19,875 --> 01:18:21,250
In her kindness.

1059
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:27,666
I believed in her ability to save us.

1060
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,375
[melancholy music plays]

1061
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:41,583

[creature roars]

1066
01:19:17,458 --> 01:19:19,791
The great General Titus.

1067
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:24,500
Thank you.

1068
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:27,083
[Gunnar] Okay.

1069
01:19:27,166 --> 01:19:28,541
[creature chitters]

1070
01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:29,625
[Kai] Oof.

1071
01:19:30,708 --> 01:19:31,916
[creature sniffles]

1072
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,916
Are you sure this is a good idea?

1073
01:19:35,625 --> 01:19:37,583
Let's clean him up and get him sober.

1074
01:19:37,666 --> 01:19:39,958
-Yeah, that'll do it.
-[Tarak] Come on.

1075
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,041
-[Gunnar] Come on.
-[Kai] You got him.

1076
01:19:42,125 --> 01:19:44,625
-[Tarak] Come on.
-Get off me! [yells]

1077
01:20:01,583 --> 01:20:03,291
What do you think you're doing?

1078
01:20:04,083 --> 01:20:06,208
That's enough. Thank you.

1079
01:20:17,041 --> 01:20:19,458
Did you command
the Eastern ranks for the Old King?

1080
01:20:21,291 --> 01:20:24,541
Are you not General Titus? A legend.

1081
01:20:25,083 --> 01:20:27,541
I don't know
what you're running your mouth about.

1082
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,416
Why can't you just leave me alone?

1083
01:20:34,625 --> 01:20:39,375
Because my best hope is that
long-ago general is still in front of me.

1084
01:20:44,416 --> 01:20:45,875
What do you want from me?

1085
01:20:45,958 --> 01:20:48,458
My men are dead because of my surrender.

1086
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:52,875
I'm tired of reliving
that nightmare every day.

1087
01:20:53,875 --> 01:20:56,958
Now, please, leave me
and let me die in peace.

1088
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:05,250
I don't think you're meant to die here…

1089
01:21:06,583 --> 01:21:07,416
General.

1090
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,583
Stop calling me that.

1091
01:21:09,166 --> 01:21:10,500
I have no rank, no privilege.

1092
01:21:10,583 --> 01:21:12,416
I'm here to make you an offer.

1093
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,250
To give you a chance at redemption.

1094
01:21:14,333 --> 01:21:18,208
-I am beyond redemption.
-I have no time for pity!

1095
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:21,208
What about all the dead men
you once commanded?

1096
01:21:21,291 --> 01:21:22,708
What about them?

1097
01:21:24,583 --> 01:21:26,166
If not redemption,

1098
01:21:27,416 --> 01:21:29,083
what about revenge?

1099
01:21:37,666 --> 01:21:40,291
[dramatic music plays]

1100
01:22:02,666 --> 01:22:04,000

[energy field warbles]

1103
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,541
This is the man
who knows where the insurgents are?

1104
01:22:41,458 --> 01:22:42,375
It is, sir.

1105
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:46,125
Well, I'm listening.

1106
01:22:47,708 --> 01:22:49,750
You'll let me go
if I tell you what I know?

1107
01:22:49,833 --> 01:22:51,666
I'll set you free, you have my word.

1108
01:22:53,625 --> 01:22:56,666
I haven't seen
Devra Bloodaxe for a full season,

1109
01:22:56,750 --> 01:23:00,500
but at the time they were on Sharaan,
under the protection of a king called…

1110
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:04,500
Levitica.

1111
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:07,625
[Noble] Go on.

1112
01:23:08,666 --> 01:23:10,875
This was some time ago,
but they were definitely there.

1113
01:23:13,083 --> 01:23:15,375
Talk to him, to Levitica.

1114
01:23:16,708 --> 01:23:19,208
I certainly will. Thank you.

1115
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
[bolt gun hisses]

1116
01:23:31,291 --> 01:23:32,833
Thought we had a deal!

1117
01:23:32,916 --> 01:23:33,916
Yes, we did.

1118
01:23:34,666 --> 01:23:35,916
[machinery clicks]

1119
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,208
[system beeps]

1120
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:39,833
You're free.

1121
01:23:45,208 --> 01:23:46,333
[body thuds]

1122
01:23:49,458 --> 01:23:52,791
[Noble] Dissect his brain and see
if we can find out any more information.

1123
01:23:54,333 --> 01:23:56,708
Then we'll go
pay our respects to King Levitica.

1124
01:23:57,625 --> 01:24:00,041
[Cassius] Yes, Admiral.
I'll set a course for Sharaan.

1125
01:24:02,833 --> 01:24:03,833
Let's go.

1126
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,375
[freighter engine rumbles]

1127
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,791
[in Sharaanese] Your patience
is appreciated and I can assure you…

1128
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:38,375
…Devra is aware of your presence.

1129
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:44,875
A decision when to receive you
is imminent.

1130
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:51,041
Thank you, Levitica, honored king.

1131
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:57,291
We await their arrival.

1132
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:09,208
-[distant boom]
-[Gunnar in English] Look.

1133
01:25:09,291 --> 01:25:10,708
[Bloodaxe fleet approaches]

1134
01:25:14,166 --> 01:25:16,166
[dramatic music plays]

1135
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:15,791
Farmer, why would you contact us
from this unknown and flagless vessel?

1136
01:26:15,875 --> 01:26:19,958
I was assuming we had a level of trust
after our last meeting.

1137
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:22,791
We bought your grain to feed our fighters.

1138
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:27,541
Do not confuse your business of commerce
with our business of revolution.

1139
01:26:27,625 --> 01:26:29,125
[Gunnar] I understand.

1140
01:26:29,208 --> 01:26:33,458
Your coming here is a great risk
to us all and to our benefactor.

1141
01:26:33,541 --> 01:26:36,166
But we are no longer
in need of your grain.

1142
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:39,291
King Levitica's kindness
has been more than enough to sustain us,

1143
01:26:39,375 --> 01:26:42,041
so I suggest you leave immediately.

1144
01:26:42,125 --> 01:26:43,958
[Kora] We're not here to sell grain.

1145
01:26:44,041 --> 01:26:46,083
Gunnar's village
was visited by a Dreadnought

1146
01:26:46,166 --> 01:26:48,208
that threatens its very existence.

1147
01:26:48,291 --> 01:26:49,875
I have recruited these warriors

1148
01:26:49,958 --> 01:26:52,916
and given my word to bring them back
and defend the farmers.

1149
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,291
-But we're running out of time.
-What?

1150
01:26:55,875 --> 01:26:58,625
This handful? Against a Dreadnought?

1151
01:26:58,708 --> 01:27:01,208
That's why we have come.
You have men and ships.

1152
01:27:01,958 --> 01:27:03,916
With you we could mount a real defense.

1153
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,958
And, of course, we can pay you
with the surplus from our harvest.

1154
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:11,875
It's all we've got.

1155
01:27:11,958 --> 01:27:14,125
[Devra] My forces against the King's Gaze?

1156
01:27:14,208 --> 01:27:15,250
That's suicide.

1157
01:27:15,833 --> 01:27:18,416
That ship cannot be destroyed
by a few dozen fighters.

1158
01:27:18,958 --> 01:27:23,166
That ship and the men aboard it
are world destroyers.

1159
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:25,583
I'm sorry, it's impossible.

1160
01:27:25,666 --> 01:27:27,833
[Kora] This man is not a revolutionary.

1161
01:27:27,916 --> 01:27:29,666
He's a simple farmer.

1162
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:31,083
But commerce or not,

1163
01:27:31,166 --> 01:27:35,000
his people toiled with their bare hands
to grow the grain that fed you.

1164
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:35,916
All of you!

1165
01:27:36,541 --> 01:27:38,541
And because of that transaction,

1166
01:27:38,625 --> 01:27:41,375
their village is now
threatened by Admiral Noble,

1167
01:27:41,458 --> 01:27:44,291
in pursuit of <i>your </i>revolution.

1168
01:27:47,916 --> 01:27:49,916
[suspenseful music plays]

1169
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I see.

1170
01:28:12,208 --> 01:28:13,208
I will go.

1171
01:28:15,416 --> 01:28:16,250
Thank you.

1172
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:18,666
Brother, a word.

1173
01:28:26,958 --> 01:28:31,791
Our victories, what few there have been,
have been tactical ones.

1174
01:28:31,875 --> 01:28:34,125
We cannot fight in the open
against the King's Gaze.

1175
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:38,041
If the farmer found us,
it won't be long before Noble does.

1176
01:28:38,791 --> 01:28:43,791
And I will not allow another world
to fall in our name.

1177
01:28:43,875 --> 01:28:45,041
[Devra sighs]

1178
01:28:46,916 --> 01:28:48,583
And what of those you command?

1179
01:28:51,541 --> 01:28:53,083
[Darrian] Their lives are theirs.

1180
01:28:56,291 --> 01:28:57,500
[Devra] Hmm.

1181
01:29:10,666 --> 01:29:14,250
These people, they've come to us with

1182
01:29:15,041 --> 01:29:16,666
nowhere else to turn.

1183
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:18,958
They come…

1184
01:29:19,625 --> 01:29:21,000
…seeking our help…

1185
01:29:22,083 --> 01:29:25,500
…to stand against
a Dreadnought of the Motherworld.

1186
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,125
Is that not what we stand for?

1187
01:29:31,375 --> 01:29:34,708
Are they not who we once were?

1188
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:42,708
If we will not stand with these
defiant farmers to protect their home,

1189
01:29:43,291 --> 01:29:45,750
then the revolution is meaningless.

1190
01:29:47,791 --> 01:29:48,875
Under free will,

1191
01:29:49,541 --> 01:29:52,916
who among you
is willing to die for what we believe

1192
01:29:53,916 --> 01:29:55,708
rather than hide behind it?

1193
01:30:12,125 --> 01:30:13,208
[Darrian] Milius.

1194
01:30:14,541 --> 01:30:15,833
Why am I not surprised?

1195
01:30:16,416 --> 01:30:20,541
Who is going to make sure
you'll return in one piece, if not me?

1196
01:30:40,708 --> 01:30:43,375
Thank Levitica and leave this planet.

1197
01:30:46,291 --> 01:30:48,125
[Kai pats on back]

1198
01:30:48,208 --> 01:30:50,625
Sister, until we meet again.

1199
01:30:54,083 --> 01:30:55,208
[Darrian whistles]

1200
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:01,375
Maybe this isn't suicide after all.

1201
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:05,291
[ship engines blast]

1202
01:31:27,166 --> 01:31:28,833
Why would he agree to help you?

1203
01:31:29,833 --> 01:31:33,041
Bloodaxe? You think they shouldn't?

1204
01:31:35,666 --> 01:31:37,166
It just seems short-sighted.

1205
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:41,125
I mean, he weakens what little of

1206
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:43,583
whatever word
you wanna use for it there is…

1207
01:31:44,375 --> 01:31:46,333
Resistance, insurgency.

1208
01:31:47,291 --> 01:31:48,416
For what, Kora?

1209
01:31:50,375 --> 01:31:52,708
The chance to get obliterated
by a Dreadnought?

1210
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:55,583
Guilt, it's a powerful thing.

1211
01:31:56,291 --> 01:31:59,416
[Kai] Aye, guilt. The underbelly of honor.

1212
01:32:00,708 --> 01:32:02,500
I think I might've had that once.

1213
01:32:03,791 --> 01:32:04,791
Honor.

1214
01:32:05,708 --> 01:32:06,958
Would you believe that?

1215
01:32:08,875 --> 01:32:09,875
It's true.

1216
01:32:11,958 --> 01:32:13,416
I mean, what do you figure?

1217
01:32:14,458 --> 01:32:19,916
I got ten, fifteen more seasons at most,
before I steal from the wrong man.

1218
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:24,875
Get stabbed to death by some
dog-headed son of a bitch in a bar fight.

1219
01:32:24,958 --> 01:32:25,958
[Kora chuckles]

1220
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,375
It's really your fault, anyway.

1221
01:32:30,458 --> 01:32:32,708
Makin' me wanna be an honorable man.

1222
01:32:33,625 --> 01:32:35,791
If you had more
resisting power to speak of,

1223
01:32:35,875 --> 01:32:38,041
you wouldn't need me to join you so badly.

1224
01:32:39,791 --> 01:32:41,416
You're willing to fight with us?

1225
01:32:42,375 --> 01:32:43,541
Since you're beggin'.

1226
01:32:44,791 --> 01:32:47,166
Kai, we're not.

1227
01:32:47,791 --> 01:32:49,291
Well, since you're asking, then.

1228
01:32:49,958 --> 01:32:51,208
If you'll allow me.

1229
01:32:51,916 --> 01:32:52,916
Wow.

1230
01:32:56,333 --> 01:32:57,791
There is one complication.

1231
01:32:58,458 --> 01:33:00,041
The shite in the cargo hold.

1232
01:33:00,833 --> 01:33:02,541
I got buyers waiting in Gondival.

1233
01:33:03,041 --> 01:33:05,458
Aren't the kinds known for their patience.

1234
01:33:05,541 --> 01:33:07,833
Might be wise
to sever my ties to life as a thief

1235
01:33:07,916 --> 01:33:10,416
before we go
picking a fight with a Dreadnought.

1236
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,166
Besides, you said yourself you need me.

1237
01:33:16,125 --> 01:33:18,375
-I did not say that.
-I think you did.

1238
01:33:18,458 --> 01:33:20,791
I'll set the course
and let 'em know we're on our way.

1239
01:33:20,875 --> 01:33:23,291
Oh, shit, does that make me
one of the good guys?

1240
01:33:23,375 --> 01:33:24,291
[Kora chuckles]

1241
01:33:26,541 --> 01:33:28,291
[grunts, whimpers]

1242
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:31,875
[in Sharaanese] I beg you…

1243
01:33:32,875 --> 01:33:34,000
[distant explosion]

1244
01:33:34,083 --> 01:33:35,083
[in English] Please!

1245
01:33:36,541 --> 01:33:38,041
I've told you the truth.

1246
01:33:39,625 --> 01:33:41,458
I have nothing more.

1247
01:33:43,541 --> 01:33:44,583
[Noble] Right.

1248
01:33:44,666 --> 01:33:45,958
[scoffs] The truth…

1249
01:33:47,333 --> 01:33:50,166
…that you took them in,
known enemies of the Motherworld,

1250
01:33:51,083 --> 01:33:53,958
mended their wounds,
repaired their broken ships,

1251
01:33:54,041 --> 01:33:57,291
all out of your
moral code of honor and charity.

1252
01:33:57,375 --> 01:34:02,666
Our civilization has lived
and thrived for 10,000 years

1253
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:07,750
with honor and charity
as its most valued tenets.

1254
01:34:07,833 --> 01:34:10,541
Yes. Yes, honor and charity.

1255
01:34:13,208 --> 01:34:14,208
Do you see that?

1256
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:19,416
That ship is named the King's Gaze.

1257
01:34:20,208 --> 01:34:22,208
It was named to honor our slain father.

1258
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:26,166
So…

1259
01:34:28,083 --> 01:34:29,416
honor I understand.

1260
01:34:32,916 --> 01:34:34,208
Charity, I do not.

1261
01:34:35,375 --> 01:34:38,375
Our King showed charity
to an off-worlder like yourself

1262
01:34:38,458 --> 01:34:40,333
and was slaughtered for his charity.

1263
01:34:41,041 --> 01:34:45,750
So, we named the ship to remind us
of the power in that benevolent gaze

1264
01:34:45,833 --> 01:34:48,250
that was lost to charity.

1265
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:54,250
And to remember that, if by God's will,
that gaze should fall upon us and be held,

1266
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:57,458
for even the briefest of moments,

1267
01:34:58,958 --> 01:35:00,958
it could change your life forever.

1268
01:35:03,041 --> 01:35:04,541
Today, it falls upon you.

1269
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:12,500
[rousing choral anthem plays]

1270
01:35:20,375 --> 01:35:22,166
We are cleared to engage.

1271
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:24,041
-[systems beep]
-Confirmed.

1272
01:35:24,625 --> 01:35:25,625
[commander] Fire at will.

1273
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,750
[Cassius] Sir, we received a message
from one of our Hawkshaws.

1274
01:35:35,458 --> 01:35:37,583
They're closing in on the Bloodaxes.

1275
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:39,708
[Noble] Ah.

1276
01:35:40,875 --> 01:35:42,541
Finally, some good news.

1277
01:35:43,666 --> 01:35:45,291
Well, prepare the hyperlaunch.

1278
01:35:45,375 --> 01:35:48,500
I'll go ahead and personally retrieve
the treasonous dogs myself.

1279
01:35:49,083 --> 01:35:51,083
[rousing choral anthem continues]

1280
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:57,708
And what orders for the King's Gaze, sir?

1281
01:35:58,291 --> 01:36:00,333
Well, once you've razed the planet,

1282
01:36:00,416 --> 01:36:04,291
we'll rendezvous, extract the exact
location of the rest of the insurgents,

1283
01:36:04,875 --> 01:36:06,833
and destroy them once and for all.

1284
01:36:06,916 --> 01:36:07,750
[Cassius] Yes, sir.

1285
01:36:07,833 --> 01:36:09,833
[foreboding music plays]

1286
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:13,958
[distant explosions]

1287
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:39,208
[ships whir and hum]

1288
01:36:50,375 --> 01:36:51,833
[mechanical rumbling]

1289
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:02,125
[Gunnar] I'm pretty sure
Kai said these boxes.

1290
01:37:02,791 --> 01:37:04,500
-[Titus] We've got one.
-[Gunnar] Okay.

1291
01:37:04,583 --> 01:37:06,000
Aye, just take the gray ones.

1292
01:37:06,083 --> 01:37:07,416
-They're all marked.
-All right.

1293
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:11,083
For God's sake, don't look inside.
I'd hate you to think less of me.

1294
01:37:11,166 --> 01:37:12,666
[ventilators hiss]

1295
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:15,041
[ventilators stop]

1296
01:37:15,791 --> 01:37:16,625
Ho!

1297
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:20,500
Where do you want them?

1298
01:37:20,583 --> 01:37:22,875
-There's space behind the bridge.
-Done.

1299
01:37:24,833 --> 01:37:26,833
All right, put them
the other side of the bridge.

1300
01:37:29,875 --> 01:37:32,500
Aye, let's unload
and get off this godforsaken rock.

1301
01:37:33,083 --> 01:37:34,958
I'll be happy to leave this life behind.

1302
01:37:35,625 --> 01:37:36,541
Good.

1303
01:37:42,916 --> 01:37:44,333
[indistinct announcement on PA]

1304
01:37:44,416 --> 01:37:47,000
[Hawkshaw] Just wanna make sure
that one's on the manifest.

1305
01:37:49,541 --> 01:37:50,708
[crate thuds]

1306
01:37:50,791 --> 01:37:52,291
[ship engines whoosh]

1307
01:37:58,666 --> 01:37:59,666
[Darrian] Pilots!

1308
01:38:00,333 --> 01:38:03,708
Once you tie off those ships,
see if you can get some fuel.

1309
01:38:07,125 --> 01:38:10,791
And you two, keep eyes from above!

1310
01:38:11,541 --> 01:38:12,833
[ship engine blasts]

1311
01:38:21,875 --> 01:38:23,875
[ominous music plays]

1312
01:38:32,791 --> 01:38:33,916
How we lookin'?

1313
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:35,833
Everything is done.

1314
01:38:37,708 --> 01:38:39,875
-[Kai] All right, let's move.
-[Hawkshaw] Yes.

1315
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,666
-[comms beeps]
-On your mark.

1316
01:38:44,541 --> 01:38:45,666
This isn't right.

1317
01:38:56,833 --> 01:38:58,666
[explosions]

1318
01:39:15,458 --> 01:39:16,958
[exoskeleton clanks]

[Kora screams]

01:39:24,083 --> 01:39:26,125
[Darrian grunts, struggles]

[Hawkshaws clamor]

1324
01:39:39,625 --> 01:39:40,791
On your knees.

1325
01:39:44,583 --> 01:39:45,666
[Gunnar grunts]

1326
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:47,625
Now is not the time to be a hero.

1327
01:39:48,125 --> 01:39:50,875
[breathes heavily]

1328
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,291
[King's Gaze rumbles]

1329
01:39:58,375 --> 01:39:59,375
When?

1330
01:40:00,625 --> 01:40:04,416
[Kai] On Veldt, in Providence,
the first time I heard your story.

1331
01:40:05,416 --> 01:40:09,500
Thought with your ideals of resistance
I could round up a couple of heads.

1332
01:40:09,583 --> 01:40:11,333
Tarak for instance.

1333
01:40:12,083 --> 01:40:13,916
His world enslaved.

1334
01:40:15,166 --> 01:40:16,541
Then there was Nemesis.

1335
01:40:17,666 --> 01:40:19,291
Her whole family slaughtered.

1336
01:40:20,666 --> 01:40:22,250
But General Titus?

1337
01:40:23,291 --> 01:40:26,708
Have you any idea
how much he alone is worth?

1338
01:40:27,916 --> 01:40:29,500
They would've all jumped at the chance

1339
01:40:29,583 --> 01:40:31,916
to exact any small vengeance
against the Realm.

1340
01:40:33,291 --> 01:40:35,875
Even if the payment
was only a sack of grain.

1341
01:40:39,041 --> 01:40:42,291
Then there was you. Kora.

1342
01:40:43,916 --> 01:40:46,125
Or should I call you Arthelais?

1343
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:49,583
The biggest prize of them all.

1344
01:40:51,791 --> 01:40:54,291
Do you know what
the Motherworld did to my planet?

1345
01:40:54,875 --> 01:40:57,000
They didn't just destroy it.

1346
01:40:58,750 --> 01:41:02,166
They tortured every man, woman, and child.

1347
01:41:04,041 --> 01:41:08,500
Left them clingin' to life
as they turned them to ash from low orbit.

1348
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:11,791
You know what that taught me?

1349
01:41:13,250 --> 01:41:16,458
Never set foot
on the wrong side of history.

1350
01:41:16,541 --> 01:41:18,500
[Kora] Is that what you think we're doing?

1351
01:41:19,625 --> 01:41:20,583
[Kai] No.

1352
01:41:20,666 --> 01:41:24,125
You've chosen the side that
doesn't even make it to the history books.

1353
01:41:25,250 --> 01:41:26,750
What happened to honor?

1354
01:41:27,375 --> 01:41:29,000
What did happen to it?

1355
01:41:30,291 --> 01:41:31,666
Piece of shit.

1356
01:41:39,666 --> 01:41:41,250
Well, who all have we got here?

1357
01:41:44,083 --> 01:41:45,000
Who indeed?

1358
01:41:46,791 --> 01:41:47,791
Commander Bloodaxe.

1359
01:41:49,208 --> 01:41:50,583
Leader of the very insurgency

1360
01:41:50,666 --> 01:41:54,000
the King's Gaze was sent to
this backwater of the galaxy to capture.

1361
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:56,833
He alone will secure
my seat in the Senate.

1362
01:41:58,333 --> 01:42:02,458
I would be remiss if I failed to mention
we are in the presence of royalty.

1363
01:42:03,541 --> 01:42:05,250
Tarak Decimus.

1364
01:42:05,333 --> 01:42:08,125
Or should I say Prince Tarak? [scoffs]

1365
01:42:09,208 --> 01:42:10,208
General Titus.

1366
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:12,708
Needs no introduction, does he?

1367
01:42:12,791 --> 01:42:15,958
His actions
at the Battle of Sarawu precede him.

1368
01:42:17,875 --> 01:42:19,000
The farmer.

1369
01:42:21,541 --> 01:42:22,875
The ambitious farmer.

1370
01:42:23,958 --> 01:42:26,333
I pride myself on never being surprised.

1371
01:42:27,208 --> 01:42:28,375
And yet, here I am.

1372
01:42:29,833 --> 01:42:33,458
I understand
why all of them are here… but you.

1373
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:39,250
What could you have possibly hoped to gain
by mounting such a… feeble stand?

1374
01:42:40,291 --> 01:42:41,125
Tell me.

1375
01:42:45,166 --> 01:42:46,416
Oh, yes.

1376
01:42:53,833 --> 01:42:57,541
The legendary swordswoman
known only by the name of Nemesis.

1377
01:42:58,916 --> 01:43:02,208
Assassinated 16 high-ranking
Imperial officers

1378
01:43:02,291 --> 01:43:04,000
and their security details.

1379
01:43:05,125 --> 01:43:08,916
All in a hunt
to avenge her slaughtered children.

1380
01:43:09,833 --> 01:43:10,750
Oh…

1381
01:43:31,708 --> 01:43:32,708
[Noble] Of course.

1382
01:43:34,791 --> 01:43:35,958
[gun clatters]

1383
01:43:36,708 --> 01:43:38,791
Now I thought I recognized
something in you,

1384
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:40,791
down in that filthy village.

1385
01:43:41,458 --> 01:43:43,333
Out there,
amongst all those simple people,

1386
01:43:45,208 --> 01:43:48,000
the most wanted fugitive
in the known universe.

1387
01:43:50,083 --> 01:43:53,458
Scargiver. Arthelais.

1388
01:43:54,083 --> 01:43:57,333
Do you know what you've
done for me, Arthelais, truly?

1389
01:43:58,583 --> 01:44:00,250
Assembling yourself as such?

1390
01:44:01,916 --> 01:44:04,166
When I lay your bodies
at the foot of the Regent,

1391
01:44:04,833 --> 01:44:06,708
I'll be a hero of the Realm.

1392
01:44:07,291 --> 01:44:09,291
They'll write songs
of my feats of courage.

1393
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:12,291
It's not like I didn't do all the work.

1394
01:44:13,708 --> 01:44:15,416
Let's move this along, shall we?

1395
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:19,250
Let's transport them paralyzed,
in case anyone's feeling frisky.

1396
01:44:20,541 --> 01:44:22,875
On your feet. I've got a job for you.

1397
01:44:25,541 --> 01:44:27,750
Look… [grunts]
Okay, okay.

1398
01:44:37,125 --> 01:44:38,416
[gun clicks]

1399
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:40,041

You're sick.

And you're a coward.

[Kai] All you have to do
is pull the trigger.

1404

[Gunnar] I won't do it.

[Kai] Yes, you will.

1406

Is what that dead bounty hunter said true?

you killed that son-of-a-bitch Noble

Tell me, Commander. Did you think
that this would be good news?

That my daughter, Arthelais,

and decorated warriors

1538
02:02:12,125 --> 02:02:17,750

is now part of a blossoming insurgency?

[Balisarius] In truth, I fear the head
most endangered here is yours.

You will crush this insurgency
to the last man, do you hear me?

1547
02:02:50,875 --> 02:02:53,375
And then you will capture
my daughter alive

1548

So that I may crucify her
