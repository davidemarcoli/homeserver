00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:24,461
<i>The forests of Pandora...</i>

2
00:01:25,254 --> 00:01:26,713
<i>hold many dangers.</i>

3
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:34,888
<i>But the most dangerous thing...</i>

4
00:01:35,013 --> 00:01:35,806
<i>about Pandora...</i>

5
00:01:40,644 --> 00:01:42,896
<i>is that you may grow
to love her too much.</i>

6
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:57,869
<i>We sing the songcords to remember.</i>

7
00:01:58,912 --> 00:01:59,913
<i>Each bead...</i>

8
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:01,581
<i>a story
in our life.</i>

9
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:05,752
<i>A bead for the
birth of our son.</i>

10
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:11,883
Neteyam!

11
00:02:12,676 --> 00:02:13,844
Neteyam!

12
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:21,810
<i>A bead...</i>

13
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:24,146
<i>when we adopted
our daughter, Kiri.</i>

14
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:27,274
<i>Born of Grace's avatar.</i>

15
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:30,736
<i>A daughter whose
conception was a total mystery.</i>

16
00:02:45,626 --> 00:02:46,251
<i>A bead...</i>

17
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:47,711
<i>for the first
communion with Eywa.</i>

18
00:02:51,757 --> 00:02:53,216
<i>The People say...</i>

19
00:02:53,342 --> 00:02:54,176
<i>we live
in Eywa...</i>

20
00:02:56,136 --> 00:02:57,971
<i>and Eywa
lives in us.</i>

21
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:02,351
<i>The Great Mother...</i>

22
00:03:02,476 --> 00:03:03,769
<i>holds all her children...</i>

23
00:03:03,894 --> 00:03:04,645
<i>in her heart.</i>

24
00:03:13,904 --> 00:03:15,030
<i>Happiness is simple.</i>

25
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:19,618
<i>But who would've thought a
jarhead like me could crack the code?</i>

26
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:31,630
<i>Before I knew it,
we had four.</i>

27
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:38,053
<i>When we sent the Sky
People back to Earth...</i>

28
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,680
<i>a few of 'em stayed.</i>

29
00:03:40,347 --> 00:03:42,224
<i>Science guys,
loyal to the</i> Na'vi.

30
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:45,310
<i>And then
there was Spider.</i>

31
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:47,312
<i>He was just stuck here.</i>

32
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,064
<i>Too young
for a cryo-capsule.</i>

33
00:03:49,648 --> 00:03:50,899
You little wild man.

34
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:51,650
See you, Norm!

35
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:52,526
<i>Orphaned by the war...</i>

36
00:03:52,693 --> 00:03:54,152
<i>he was raised
by the lab guys.</i>

37
00:03:54,278 --> 00:03:54,945
Spider, take
your spare!

38
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,488
I'm just going
to the village!

39
00:03:58,031 --> 00:03:59,616
<i>He wasn't
part of our family.</i>

40
00:03:59,783 --> 00:04:01,034
<i>He was like a stray cat.</i>

41
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:02,202
<i>Just always around.</i>

42
00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:05,706
<i>Inseparable from our kids.</i>

43
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:10,836
<i>To Neytiri...</i>

44
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:12,296
<i>he would
always be alien.</i>

45
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:14,172
<i>One of them.</i>

46
00:04:25,726 --> 00:04:28,353
{\an8}<i>Took a few years to get the
language through my thick skull.</i>

47
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:30,522
{\an8}<i>But now
when I hear it...</i>

48
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:31,648
{\an8}<i>it might as well be English.</i>

49
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:33,108
{\an8}I hate you!

50
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:36,486
Well, I hate you
times infinity, Lo'ak!

51
00:04:36,737 --> 00:04:37,738
Penis face!

52
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:39,740
Hey! Hey!
That's enough.

53
00:04:40,324 --> 00:04:41,908
Don't make me
come over there.

54
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:44,453
He's gonna come out
from behind those big rocks.

55
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,871
There he is.

56
00:04:48,707 --> 00:04:49,875
There you go.
Go get it!

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,626
Yeah!

58
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,004
Hey, Neteyam,
the mighty fisherman.

59
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:55,505
<i>There you go. Good boy.</i>

60
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:01,094
Wow, that's a big one.

61
00:05:01,261 --> 00:05:02,262
By the rocks.

62
00:05:03,597 --> 00:05:04,598
Right where
you said.

63
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:06,433
How tall is he?

64
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,435
- He's... that tall.
- He's tall!

65
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:09,811
<i>Goes by
too fast.</i>

66
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,480
<i>Like a dream.</i>

67
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:14,483
- Kiri.
- Bro, come on.

68
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,651
Come on.

69
00:05:16,735 --> 00:05:17,736
Smile, <i>skxawng.</i>

70
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,155
<i>Happiness is simple.</i>

71
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:24,618
<i>Like date night.</i>

72
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,495
<i>Time away from the kids.</i>

73
00:05:58,235 --> 00:06:00,070
<i>But the thing
about happiness...</i>

74
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:03,865
<i>it can vanish
in a heartbeat.</i>

75
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,249
<i>A new star in the night.</i>

76
00:06:14,126 --> 00:06:15,460
<i>It could only mean one thing.</i>

77
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:25,220
<i>Ships. Decelerating.</i>

78
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:35,856
<i>And Sky
People returning.</i>

79
00:09:06,048 --> 00:09:07,799
<i>Pulse 168.</i>

80
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:09,009
<i>Yeah, here it comes.</i>

81
00:09:09,176 --> 00:09:10,177
<i>You're just fine.</i>

82
00:09:10,802 --> 00:09:11,803
<i>Just lie still.</i>

83
00:09:12,304 --> 00:09:13,305
<i>Stay calm.</i>

84
00:09:15,307 --> 00:09:17,517
<i>Yep. Pupillary
reflex is good.</i>

85
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:18,810
<i>Get that out of his face.</i>

86
00:09:19,394 --> 00:09:20,020
<i>Colonel...</i>

87
00:09:20,938 --> 00:09:21,647
<i>can you hear me?</i>

88
00:09:22,064 --> 00:09:22,689
Colonel?

89
00:09:25,943 --> 00:09:27,277
You need to lie
back down, sir.

90
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:33,867
<i>Sedate him!
Sedate him!</i>

91
00:09:34,076 --> 00:09:34,993
Get outta here.

92
00:09:35,577 --> 00:09:36,244
Go, go, go!

93
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:37,204
Get security!

94
00:09:37,371 --> 00:09:38,372
- Grab him!
- Grab him!

95
00:09:39,665 --> 00:09:40,582
Hold him!

96
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:41,333
Calm down!

97
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,501
Colonel,
stand down!

98
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:43,460
Colonel...

99
00:09:43,585 --> 00:09:44,211
it's me!

100
00:09:44,586 --> 00:09:45,587
Corporal Wainfleet!

101
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:50,550
Lyle?

102
00:09:52,135 --> 00:09:53,136
That you?

103
00:09:53,637 --> 00:09:56,056
Yes, sir.
And Z Dog.

104
00:09:57,391 --> 00:09:58,392
And Fike.

105
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:03,063
I'm all right.
Let me go.

106
00:10:03,855 --> 00:10:04,856
I'm all right.

107
00:10:26,253 --> 00:10:27,254
Well...

108
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:30,382
ain't this a bitch.

109
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:43,854
<i>Stand by. Two minutes to
Pandora insertion. Secure for Delta V.</i>

110
00:10:45,897 --> 00:10:47,274
All right. Umbilical's clear.

111
00:10:48,358 --> 00:10:49,693
Pulse ox 89.

112
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,906
<i>In case you haven't figured it
out yet, you're Colonel Miles Quaritch.</i>

<i>Only younger,
taller, bluer...</i>

114
00:10:57,826 --> 00:10:59,411
<i>and not nearly
as good-lookin'.</i>

115
00:11:00,495 --> 00:11:02,164
<i>In two hours,
I fly a mission...</i>

116
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:04,041
<i>against the</i>
Na'vi's <i>stronghold.</i>

117
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:08,962
<i>The powers that be thought it prudent
that I do this backup just in case.</i>

118
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:11,298
<i>And if you are
watchin' it, well...</i>

119
00:11:11,465 --> 00:11:13,550
<i>it means that I did
get my ticket punched.</i>

120
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:16,762
<i>Hey, Parker...</i>

121
00:11:17,137 --> 00:11:18,931
<i>just what the hell am I
supposed to say now?</i>

122
00:11:19,431 --> 00:11:20,933
<i>Just remind him
how this works.</i>

123
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:22,893
<i>Here.</i>

124
00:11:23,352 --> 00:11:25,979
<i>So see this? This is all your
memories and your personality.</i>

125
00:11:26,146 --> 00:11:27,439
<i>We're gonna send
this back to Earth...</i>

126
00:11:27,606 --> 00:11:29,942
<i>where you're growing
in a lab as we speak.</i>

127
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:31,693
<i>We're gonna imprint
you with it, and then...</i>

128
00:11:31,818 --> 00:11:32,444
<i>Hey, hey, hey.</i>

129
00:11:32,611 --> 00:11:34,196
<i>Am I doin' this,
or are you doin' this?</i>

130
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:35,280
<i>Hurry it up.
Hurry it up.</i>

131
00:11:35,864 --> 00:11:37,282
<i>Anyway,
the idea...</i>

132
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:41,203
<i>is to get the minds of the
saltiest on-world operators.</i>

133
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,581
<i>Yeah, like Corporal
Wainfleet over there...</i>

134
00:11:45,374 --> 00:11:47,417
<i>and your humble
narrator into...</i>

135
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:49,127
<i>recombinant bodies.</i>

136
00:11:49,878 --> 00:11:51,421
<i>You're a

<i>loaded with my

138
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,885
<i>What you won't
remember is my death...</i>

139
00:11:57,052 --> 00:11:58,387
<i>because it

141
00:12:00,264 --> 00:12:01,682
<i>- Damn right.
- Hell yeah.</i>

142
00:12:02,224 --> 00:12:03,392
<i>Well, whatever happened...</i>

143
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,646
<i>if you're any clone of mine, you'll
be lookin' for some payback.</i>

144
00:12:07,813 --> 00:12:10,107
<i>And Jake Sully would be
at the top of that list.</i>

145
00:12:13,944 --> 00:12:14,945
<i>Remember, kid...</i>

146
00:12:15,696 --> 00:12:17,155
<i>a Marine
can't be defeated.</i>

147
00:12:17,948 --> 00:12:19,074
<i>Oh, you can kill us...</i>

148
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:21,618
<i>but we'll just

149
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:24,079
<i>Semper fi.</i>

150
00:12:52,774 --> 00:12:54,067
Ground team, go!

151
00:13:48,038 --> 00:13:49,289
Take this! Go!

152
00:13:54,127 --> 00:13:55,712
Let's go. Two
minutes, people. Let's go.

153
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:01,969
Bro, we have got
to get down there.

154
00:14:02,511 --> 00:14:04,179
No way!
Dad will skin us!

155
00:14:04,346 --> 00:14:06,098
Come on.
Don't be a wuss.

156
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,516
Lo'ak!

157
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:09,101
Get back
here, you...

158
00:14:12,396 --> 00:14:13,397
Taking the
whole case!

159
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:15,107
We're taking mags,
the RPGs, the stingers.

160
00:14:19,528 --> 00:14:20,737
Bro, let's go. Come on!

161
00:14:21,113 --> 00:14:21,947
Okay, let's go!

162
00:14:24,032 --> 00:14:25,033
Move! Take that!

163
00:14:25,951 --> 00:14:26,660
Take these weapons.

164
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:27,411
Here, boy. Go!

165
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:31,206
You don't even
know how to use it.

166
00:14:32,749 --> 00:14:34,001
Dad taught me.

167
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:42,843
Gunship's
inbound!

168
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:51,810
Bro, come on!

169
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:03,322
Lo'ak, where are you?

170
00:15:03,447 --> 00:15:04,197
Neteyam!

171
00:15:05,365 --> 00:15:06,825
Easy, easy, you okay?

172
00:15:06,992 --> 00:15:08,577
- Yeah.
- Where's your brother?

173
00:15:09,286 --> 00:15:10,412
- That way.
- Where is he? Where?

174
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:11,330
Get outta here!

175
00:15:11,455 --> 00:15:12,080
Go on!

176
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,291
Neteyam!

177
00:15:16,835 --> 00:15:17,836
Oh, no.

178
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,548
Oh, no, no, no.

179
00:15:22,257 --> 00:15:23,300
Oh, God.

180
00:15:28,555 --> 00:15:29,556
Dad?

181
00:15:32,517 --> 00:15:34,561
What are you doin' here, boy?
What the hell were you thinkin'?

182
00:15:35,646 --> 00:15:36,647
I'm sorry.

183
00:15:38,482 --> 00:15:39,524
I'm sorry, sir.

184
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,948
<i>We are not in Kansas anymore.</i>

185
00:15:47,074 --> 00:15:48,784
We are going to Pandora.

186
00:15:50,035 --> 00:15:51,078
Now...

187
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:55,040
I know you're all askin'
yourselves the same question.

188
00:15:58,043 --> 00:15:59,169
Why so blue?

189
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:05,092
For our sins
in our past life...

190
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,134
we have been
brought back...

191
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,553
<i>in the form
of our enemy.</i>

192
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,641
<i>That gives us their size,
their strength, their speed.</i>

193
00:16:13,058 --> 00:16:15,060
<i>And with
our training...</i>

194
00:16:15,477 --> 00:16:16,979
that's a pretty
potent mix.

195
00:16:18,855 --> 00:16:20,065
Do we have a
mission yet?

196
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:21,441
Indeed
we do.

197
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:24,903
Our mission is to
hunt down and kill...

198
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,989
the leader of the
<i>Na'vi</i> insurgency.

199
00:16:27,864 --> 00:16:30,993
The one they call
<i>Toruk Makto.</i>

200
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,911
Jake Sully.

201
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:34,037
Yeah!

202
00:16:41,795 --> 00:16:43,297
Attack, attack!

203
00:16:44,214 --> 00:16:45,465
Got ya!

204
00:16:45,632 --> 00:16:46,383
Tuk!

205
00:16:46,508 --> 00:16:47,134
Come on!

206
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:49,136
I'm definitely faster
when I'm blue.

207
00:16:49,303 --> 00:16:50,304
<i>Skxawng.</i>

208
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,471
No, seriously.

209
00:16:51,597 --> 00:16:52,681
And the animals
respect me more.

210
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:54,349
They don't think
of me as human.

211
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:56,226
Wait.
You're human?

212
00:17:06,403 --> 00:17:07,404
They're
coming!

213
00:17:12,701 --> 00:17:13,660
They're coming!

214
00:17:13,785 --> 00:17:14,786
Kiri, Spider!

215
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:16,829
The war party's
coming back!

216
00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:18,248
Come on,
come on.

217
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:19,790
Let's go,
come on.

218
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:35,474
<i>- Mom!</i>
- Tuk...

219
00:17:35,641 --> 00:17:37,184
- Mom.
- Tuk, Tuk, Tuk.

220
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:40,270
Fall in.

221
00:17:43,106 --> 00:17:44,566
You're supposed
to be spotters.

222
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:46,401
You spot bogeys,
and you call 'em in.

223
00:17:46,526 --> 00:17:47,611
From a
distance!

224
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:49,863
Does any of this
sound familiar? Get here!

225
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,449
Jesus. I let you two
geniuses fly a mission...

226
00:17:52,616 --> 00:17:54,284
and you disobey
direct orders.

227
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,621
Kiri, can you go help your
grandmother with the wounded? Please?

228
00:17:57,788 --> 00:17:58,789
My brother
is wounded.

229
00:17:59,206 --> 00:17:59,957
It's fine.

230
00:18:00,123 --> 00:18:01,792
<i>- Tuk, go with her. Go.</i>
- Dad.

231
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,877
Sir. I take
full responsibility.

232
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:04,711
Yeah, you do.

233
00:18:04,836 --> 00:18:05,545
<i>That's right.</i>

234
00:18:05,879 --> 00:18:08,423
'Cause you're the older
brother. You gotta act like it.

235
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:10,634
<i>MaJake.</i>

236
00:18:11,176 --> 00:18:12,928
Your son is
actually bleeding.

237
00:18:13,095 --> 00:18:14,513
Mother,
it's fine. I...

238
00:18:16,682 --> 00:18:18,600
Just go and get patched up.
Go on, dismissed.

239
00:18:24,314 --> 00:18:27,234
You do understand that you
almost got your brother killed.

240
00:18:27,818 --> 00:18:28,819
Yes, sir.

241
00:18:31,113 --> 00:18:32,698
You're grounded.
No flying for a month.

242
00:18:33,448 --> 00:18:35,242
<i>Now, see to the</i> ikran.
<i>All of 'em.</i>

243
00:18:35,534 --> 00:18:36,285
Yes, sir.

244
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,995
And get that
crap off your face.

245
00:18:47,129 --> 00:18:48,922
Aw, want a kiss
on the boo-boo?

246
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:50,090
- Give him this.
- Okay.

247
00:18:50,257 --> 00:18:51,800
I would use <i>yalna</i> bark.

248
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,593
Here, drink.

249
00:18:52,593 --> 00:18:53,343
Oh, you would?

250
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,220
And who
is <i>Tsahik</i>?

251
00:18:55,721 --> 00:18:56,930
You are, Grand... Move!

252
00:18:57,389 --> 00:18:59,766
You are, Grandmother.
But <i>yalna</i> bark is better.

253
00:19:02,227 --> 00:19:03,395
It stings less.

254
00:19:03,979 --> 00:19:05,314
<i>Mighty Warrior.</i>

255
00:19:13,155 --> 00:19:14,281
What?

256
00:19:16,742 --> 00:19:18,952
Neteyam and Lo'ak
try to live up to you.

257
00:19:20,746 --> 00:19:21,997
It is very
hard on them.

258
00:19:23,707 --> 00:19:24,916
I know.

259
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:29,254
You are very
hard on them.

260
00:19:31,965 --> 00:19:33,842
I'm their father.
It's my job.

261
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:37,471
This is
not a squad.

262
00:19:37,638 --> 00:19:39,139
It is a family.

263
00:19:50,233 --> 00:19:51,902
I thought
we'd lost them.

264
00:20:00,786 --> 00:20:01,870
Hey, man.
How's it going?

265
00:20:01,995 --> 00:20:02,871
Hey, Spider.

266
00:20:03,413 --> 00:20:04,790
Your ass
is mine.

267
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:05,874
I'm right here.

268
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,793
Avatars only...

269
00:20:07,918 --> 00:20:08,585
go around!

270
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:10,170
Sorry.

271
00:20:10,587 --> 00:20:12,923
Yeah. Those blue stripes
don't make you any bigger, bro.

272
00:20:13,632 --> 00:20:15,217
Yeah, well, I can
still kick your ass.

273
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,721
Hell of a day.

274
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:20,889
Long run.

275
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:25,435
Real hysterical, guys.

276
00:20:25,602 --> 00:20:27,020
You know what
really sucks though?

277
00:20:27,145 --> 00:20:28,313
Is you can breathe
Earth air for hours...

278
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,066
and I can only breathe
your air for, like, 10 seconds.

279
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:33,610
Yeah, Monkey Boy,
that really sucks.

280
00:20:33,777 --> 00:20:34,778
For you.

281
00:20:41,743 --> 00:20:43,328
- Hi, Max.
- Hey, kids.

282
00:20:43,495 --> 00:20:44,162
Hey. What's up, Max?

283
00:20:44,871 --> 00:20:45,539
What's up, Norm?

284
00:20:51,587 --> 00:20:52,462
Hi, Ma.

285
00:21:03,223 --> 00:21:05,767
<i>Maybe I'm just losing it out here...</i>

286
00:21:05,934 --> 00:21:07,686
<i>but I'm seeing real evidence...</i>

287
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:11,565
<i>of a systemic response on a global level.</i>

288
00:21:12,316 --> 00:21:13,400
<i>I can't...</i>

289
00:21:14,693 --> 00:21:17,613
<i>I won't use the term
"intelligence." It's...</i>

290
00:21:18,697 --> 00:21:20,782
<i>maybe "awareness"
is a better word.</i>

291
00:21:21,658 --> 00:21:25,621
<i>It's like the entire
biosphere of Pandora...</i>

292
00:21:25,746 --> 00:21:27,122
<i>is aware...</i>

293
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:30,375
<i>and capable of this
cognitive response.</i>

294
00:21:32,085 --> 00:21:33,462
<i>Oh, crap,
I can't say that.</i>

295
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:35,464
<i>They'll
crucify me.</i>

296
00:21:36,131 --> 00:21:37,090
<i>I mean,
I need to say...</i>

297
00:21:37,966 --> 00:21:39,968
So who do you think
knocked her up?

298
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:41,970
Pretty sure it was Norm.

299
00:21:42,137 --> 00:21:43,138
Totally.

300
00:21:44,848 --> 00:21:46,600
You do not
deserve to live.

301
00:21:46,808 --> 00:21:48,101
No, no, no.
Think about it, right?

302
00:21:48,268 --> 00:21:49,561
I mean, he's the
teacher's pet.

303
00:21:49,728 --> 00:21:51,188
He's out at the lab
with her all the time.

304
00:21:51,396 --> 00:21:53,273
I would
kill myself.

305
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,775
I would
drink acid.

306
00:21:54,942 --> 00:21:56,902
Bro, you're right.
He's, like, in every shot.

307
00:21:57,069 --> 00:21:59,321
Bro, look, look,
he's giving her looks.

308
00:21:59,488 --> 00:22:00,489
Hey.

309
00:22:01,156 --> 00:22:02,699
See, I'm thinkin'...

310
00:22:02,866 --> 00:22:05,577
their two avatars were out
in the woods all alone...

311
00:22:06,203 --> 00:22:06,995
Gross!

312
00:22:07,162 --> 00:22:07,913
Guys.

313
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:10,791
I mean, sometimes it's not
so great to know who your father was.

314
00:22:15,504 --> 00:22:16,505
Whatever.

315
00:22:17,172 --> 00:22:18,423
Don't even
remember him.

316
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,841
No, Spider.

317
00:22:20,008 --> 00:22:21,802
- Dude.
- Spider...

318
00:22:24,221 --> 00:22:25,639
You are not him.

319
00:23:06,305 --> 00:23:08,849
<i>Go, go, go!
Directly inside the terminal.</i>

320
00:23:09,016 --> 00:23:10,058
<i>Do not stop.</i>

321
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,689
Masks off.

322
00:23:20,527 --> 00:23:21,528
Sir...

323
00:23:21,653 --> 00:23:23,030
this is
the General.

324
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:34,291
General
Ardmore.

325
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,668
Good to meet you, Colonel.

326
00:23:37,461 --> 00:23:38,670
I've heard good things...

327
00:23:39,463 --> 00:23:41,465
but a lot's changed
since your last tour here.

328
00:23:41,673 --> 00:23:42,507
Walk with me.

329
00:23:45,469 --> 00:23:47,679
The new ops
center is over here.

330
00:23:47,846 --> 00:23:49,014
That just came online.

331
00:23:49,806 --> 00:23:52,809
These Swarm Assemblers,
they can put up a building in six days.

332
00:23:53,936 --> 00:23:57,606
We have done more here in a year
than in the previous 30 years.

333
00:23:59,274 --> 00:24:01,193
We're not here to
run a mine, Colonel.

334
00:24:01,693 --> 00:24:02,861
As On-World
Commander...

335
00:24:02,986 --> 00:24:04,780
I have been charged
with a greater mission.

336
00:24:10,285 --> 00:24:11,370
Earth
is dying.

337
00:24:12,746 --> 00:24:15,874
Our task here is to
tame this frontier.

338
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,752
Nothing less than
to make Pandora...

339
00:24:18,877 --> 00:24:20,128
the new home
for humanity.

340
00:24:21,713 --> 00:24:23,757
But before
we can do that...

341
00:24:23,924 --> 00:24:26,176
we need to
pacify the hostiles.

342
00:24:28,971 --> 00:24:32,099
Sully's raids are becoming
bolder and more frequent.

343
00:24:33,016 --> 00:24:34,643
His strikes are well-planned.

344
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:37,479
He's got tight coordination
between his ground and air assets.

345
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,359
His forces are hitting our
outlying sites. The mines, pipelines...

346
00:24:42,526 --> 00:24:44,152
cutting off our supply chain.

347
00:24:44,778 --> 00:24:46,905
And they hit a maglev two days ago.

348
00:24:51,868 --> 00:24:53,453
Any intel on Sully's...

349
00:24:53,578 --> 00:24:54,705
base of operations?

350
00:24:54,871 --> 00:24:56,123
Yeah.
Give me the mountains.

351
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:01,044
It's a cave system in the
Hallelujah Mountains somewhere.

352
00:25:03,255 --> 00:25:06,216
But every time we send our
forces up there, we take losses.

353
00:25:07,676 --> 00:25:10,387
Our hardware really
stirs up the hornet's nest.

354
00:25:11,555 --> 00:25:13,432
We only get 10 minutes
in enemy airspace...

355
00:25:13,557 --> 00:25:14,975
they are all over us.

356
00:25:18,061 --> 00:25:19,062
Colonel...

357
00:25:19,229 --> 00:25:22,190
we believe your Blue Team will
be perceived as indigenous...

358
00:25:22,357 --> 00:25:24,026
and will not trigger...

359
00:25:24,151 --> 00:25:24,943
the immune response.

360
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,946
And how might we test
that hypothesis, General?

361
00:25:28,989 --> 00:25:30,073
The hard way.

362
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,076
Outstanding.

363
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,467
<i>We're entering
hostile airspace.</i>

364
00:25:49,217 --> 00:25:50,260
Copy that.

365
00:26:00,312 --> 00:26:02,272
- Bro!
- Go, Monkey Boy!

366
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:04,608
Guys, wait up!

367
00:26:41,395 --> 00:26:42,980
Tuk!
Keep up!

368
00:26:43,647 --> 00:26:44,982
Okay, okay.

369
00:26:45,148 --> 00:26:46,483
Bro, why'd you
bring her anyway?

370
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:48,193
She's such
a cry baby.

371
00:26:48,735 --> 00:26:50,821
She's all,
"I'm telling.

372
00:26:50,946 --> 00:26:51,738
"You're not supposed
to go to the battlefield.

373
00:26:51,905 --> 00:26:53,740
"I'll tell Mom if you
don't let me come."

374
00:26:53,865 --> 00:26:55,075
Don't pick on her.

375
00:26:57,077 --> 00:26:58,078
Come on.

376
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:00,706
Oh, sick!

377
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:03,375
Are there any
dead bodies up there?

378
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:05,294
<i>Bro, check it out.
Come on.</i>

379
00:27:49,713 --> 00:27:50,714
No shit.

380
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:02,601
Kiri.

381
00:28:03,018 --> 00:28:04,019
Kiri.

382
00:28:07,022 --> 00:28:08,023
Kiri...

383
00:28:08,523 --> 00:28:09,524
Kiri, hey.

384
00:28:09,691 --> 00:28:10,692
Hey.

385
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:16,782
Are you okay?

386
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:20,118
I was doing that
thing again, wasn't I?

387
00:28:20,535 --> 00:28:22,329
Yeah, you were.

388
00:28:23,163 --> 00:28:24,164
Kiri!

389
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:26,375
- Kiri!
- Kiri, we have to get back.

390
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:27,542
All right,
come on.

391
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:33,966
What is it?

392
00:28:34,841 --> 00:28:36,969
We're always supposed
to be home by eclipse.

393
00:28:39,721 --> 00:28:41,556
It's way too
big for a human.

394
00:28:41,723 --> 00:28:43,100
- Avatars?
- Maybe...

395
00:28:44,142 --> 00:28:46,019
but they're for
sure not ours.

396
00:28:47,771 --> 00:28:48,772
What are you doing?

397
00:28:48,939 --> 00:28:50,232
I'm tracking.

398
00:29:09,501 --> 00:29:10,502
Watch your six.

399
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:14,631
Clear.

400
00:29:18,885 --> 00:29:19,761
Perimeter
up.

401
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:34,067
Damn.

402
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,300
<i>We are never supposed to come here.</i>

403
00:29:59,927 --> 00:30:01,219
Dad is going
to ground you.

404
00:30:01,678 --> 00:30:02,596
Can you stop?

405
00:30:02,721 --> 00:30:03,513
For life.

406
00:30:04,598 --> 00:30:05,933
Bro, we have got to
check this out.

407
00:30:06,266 --> 00:30:07,059
Let's go.

408
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,661
Bro...

409
00:30:26,244 --> 00:30:27,704
that's where your dad and my dad...

410
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,581
fought.

411
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,792
That's your
dad's actual suit.

412
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:34,002
Holy shit.

413
00:30:35,254 --> 00:30:36,672
Lyle,
see if you can...

414
00:30:36,922 --> 00:30:38,757
pull some data
off that dash cam.

415
00:30:39,758 --> 00:30:41,718
That thing's deader
than shit, Colonel.

416
00:30:41,885 --> 00:30:42,678
So were we.

417
00:30:42,803 --> 00:30:43,428
All right.

418
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:45,472
I gotta call
this in.

419
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:47,057
No, bro, we're gonna
get in trouble.

420
00:30:47,224 --> 00:30:48,225
Let's go.

421
00:30:52,813 --> 00:30:55,357
<i>Devil Dog, Devil Dog,
this is Eagle Eye, over.</i>

422
00:30:55,857 --> 00:30:57,609
Eagle Eye.
Send your traffic.

423
00:30:57,776 --> 00:30:59,069
I got eyes
on some guys.

424
00:31:00,237 --> 00:31:02,906
They look
like avatars...

425
00:31:03,115 --> 00:31:05,200
<i>but they're in full camo
and carrying ARs.</i>

426
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:08,245
<i>There's six of them. Over.</i>

427
00:31:08,412 --> 00:31:09,663
What's your pos?
Over.

428
00:31:11,999 --> 00:31:13,250
We're at
the old shack.

429
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,421
Who's "we"?

430
00:31:18,422 --> 00:31:20,382
Me, Spider, Kiri...

431
00:31:22,175 --> 00:31:23,176
and Tuk.

432
00:31:28,765 --> 00:31:30,601
Son, you listen to
me very carefully.

433
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:31,768
You pull back
right now.

434
00:31:31,893 --> 00:31:32,811
Do not
make a sound.

435
00:31:32,978 --> 00:31:34,229
<i>You get the
hell out of there.</i>

436
00:31:34,354 --> 00:31:35,147
<i>Move! You copy?</i>

437
00:31:35,564 --> 00:31:36,565
Yes, sir,
moving out.

438
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:37,316
See,
I told you!

439
00:31:37,316 --> 00:31:38,025
Go, go.

440
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,901
Dad...

441
00:31:40,235 --> 00:31:41,445
I know
a quick way!

442
00:31:47,075 --> 00:31:48,660
You're going to be
in so much trouble.

443
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:50,120
Kiri, stop.

444
00:31:50,287 --> 00:31:51,413
Guys,
come on.

445
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,623
It's almost eclipse,
come on.

446
00:31:55,584 --> 00:31:56,585
Put it down!
Down!

447
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:58,420
Put it down or
I'll shoot you!

448
00:31:58,587 --> 00:31:59,504
With me.

449
00:31:59,671 --> 00:32:00,297
<i>Drop it!</i>

450
00:32:00,297 --> 00:32:01,006
<i>Right now!</i>

451
00:32:02,591 --> 00:32:04,468
{\an8}Do not move!
Put your hands up!

452
00:32:04,927 --> 00:32:05,928
Spider.

453
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,138
Get 'em!
Get 'em!

454
00:32:08,305 --> 00:32:09,681
Get over here! Come on!

455
00:32:10,265 --> 00:32:11,391
Get down!

456
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,101
Stop fighting.

457
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:14,811
Don't move!

458
00:32:14,978 --> 00:32:15,979
<i>Check 'em
for weapons!</i>

459
00:32:16,605 --> 00:32:17,606
Kiri!

460
00:32:20,734 --> 00:32:21,360
Shut up.

461
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,069
Don't move.

462
00:32:22,903 --> 00:32:24,154
What have we here?

463
00:32:34,206 --> 00:32:35,082
Hey, Colonel...

464
00:32:35,207 --> 00:32:35,999
check it out.

465
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:37,542
Four fingers.

466
00:32:38,085 --> 00:32:39,211
We got a half-breed.

467
00:32:39,586 --> 00:32:40,587
Shit...

468
00:32:47,177 --> 00:32:48,428
Show me
your fingers.

469
00:32:53,934 --> 00:32:56,520
You're his,
aren't you?

470
00:32:58,647 --> 00:32:59,982
You're his,
all right.

471
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,864
Where is he?

472
00:33:19,042 --> 00:33:20,043
No!

473
00:33:22,212 --> 00:33:22,838
Really?

474
00:33:22,838 --> 00:33:24,381
You wanna play
it this way?

475
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:26,925
Shut up!

476
00:33:30,804 --> 00:33:31,555
Kiri!

477
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,431
No!
Stop!

478
00:33:32,973 --> 00:33:34,308
Hey! Hey,
don't touch her!

479
00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:36,018
Hey!

480
00:33:36,852 --> 00:33:37,894
Don't hurt
her, please.

481
00:33:40,147 --> 00:33:41,356
Don't move.

482
00:33:42,232 --> 00:33:43,358
What's your
name, kid?

483
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:46,486
Spider...

484
00:33:47,237 --> 00:33:48,113
Socorro.

485
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:58,290
Miles?

486
00:34:02,002 --> 00:34:03,503
Nobody calls me that.

487
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,758
Well,
I'll be damned...

488
00:34:09,301 --> 00:34:11,845
Well, I figured they
sent you back to Earth.

489
00:34:13,096 --> 00:34:15,139
They can't put
babies in cryo, dipshit.

490
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:24,148
What are we
doin', boss?

491
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:28,362
Iron Sky, Blue One, Actual.

492
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,576
Blue One, Iron Sky,
send your traffic.

493
00:34:35,452 --> 00:34:37,244
<i>We are standing by
for extract, over.</i>

494
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:39,121
Take us in.

495
00:34:39,289 --> 00:34:40,123
Dragonfly
comin' left...

496
00:34:40,248 --> 00:34:41,666
<i>we are go for extract.</i>

497
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:43,168
<i>Be advised...</i>

498
00:34:43,335 --> 00:34:44,711
we are bringin' in
high value prisoners.

499
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:45,878
Let us go!

500
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:46,588
Shut up.

501
00:34:46,588 --> 00:34:47,798
Sit tight, Blue One...

502
00:34:47,923 --> 00:34:48,757
we're inbound
to your pos.

503
00:34:49,382 --> 00:34:50,717
That's bingo in ten.

504
00:34:50,884 --> 00:34:51,927
<i>We're on the clock.</i>

505
00:34:54,596 --> 00:34:56,056
- Sit!
- Come on, in the dirt!

506
00:34:56,223 --> 00:34:57,307
- Feet up!
- Get down on the ground!

507
00:34:57,432 --> 00:34:58,058
Lyle...

508
00:34:58,058 --> 00:34:59,309
get me some
audio on this.

509
00:35:00,602 --> 00:35:01,561
Shut your mouth.

510
00:35:01,561 --> 00:35:02,312
Don't look up!

511
00:35:03,438 --> 00:35:04,189
That's
Sully's woman.

512
00:35:05,857 --> 00:35:06,984
She's an animal.

513
00:35:08,151 --> 00:35:09,152
<i>Give it up, Quaritch.</i>

514
00:35:10,404 --> 00:35:11,405
Sully.

515
00:35:11,571 --> 00:35:12,990
<i>- It's all over.</i>
- Son of a bitch.

516
00:35:14,283 --> 00:35:16,034
<i>Nothin's over
while I'm breathin'.</i>

517
00:35:17,577 --> 00:35:18,912
<i>I kinda hoped you'd say that.</i>

518
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:37,431
No, no, you stay
with the <i>ikran.</i>

519
00:35:37,598 --> 00:35:38,682
But, Dad...

520
00:35:38,807 --> 00:35:39,516
I'm a warrior
like you.

521
00:35:39,641 --> 00:35:40,267
I'm supposed
to fight.

522
00:35:40,392 --> 00:35:41,184
Neteyam.

523
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:43,103
I'm not gonna
say it again.

524
00:35:44,813 --> 00:35:45,814
Yes, sir.

525
00:36:08,629 --> 00:36:10,047
Yeah, there's
nothin' after that.

526
00:36:24,353 --> 00:36:25,771
<i>You want us to recover these remains?</i>

527
00:36:52,172 --> 00:36:53,924
<i>Blue One, stand by ready.</i>

528
00:36:54,091 --> 00:36:55,008
<i>We are three
minutes out.</i>

529
00:36:55,175 --> 00:36:56,969
Heads up,
three minutes.

530
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:13,568
Watch our six.

531
00:38:02,868 --> 00:38:03,702
Shut up!

532
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,509
Shut up!

533
00:38:21,428 --> 00:38:22,596
Contact rear!

534
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:23,764
Contact rear!

535
00:38:27,267 --> 00:38:28,268
Lo'ak!

536
00:38:29,478 --> 00:38:30,103
Shit.

537
00:38:33,482 --> 00:38:34,107
You little shit.

538
00:38:34,107 --> 00:38:34,816
Lo'ak!

539
00:38:34,816 --> 00:38:36,318
- Tuk, come on. Go, go, go!
- Get back here!

540
00:38:36,485 --> 00:38:37,486
Run!

541
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:38,904
Grab 'em!

542
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:46,870
Come on!

543
00:38:47,913 --> 00:38:48,914
Cover!

544
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:53,752
Come on!

545
00:39:08,934 --> 00:39:10,560
That you,
Mrs. Sully?

546
00:39:11,228 --> 00:39:13,230
<i>I recognize your calling card.</i>

547
00:39:24,157 --> 00:39:25,826
Why don't you come
on out, Mrs. Sully?

548
00:39:27,536 --> 00:39:28,745
You and I,
we got some...

549
00:39:29,288 --> 00:39:30,914
<i>unfinished business.</i>

550
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,461
Demon!

551
00:39:36,962 --> 00:39:39,590
I will kill you as many
times as I have to!

552
00:39:40,716 --> 00:39:43,427
<i>I guess you and the Corporal
have been pretty...</i>

553
00:39:43,635 --> 00:39:45,178
<i>busy, haven't you?</i>

554
00:39:45,345 --> 00:39:47,264
<i>Dropped yourself a whole litter of...</i>

555
00:39:48,098 --> 00:39:49,141
<i>half-breeds.</i>

556
00:39:58,066 --> 00:39:58,775
<i>Na'vi!</i>

557
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,071
Go, go, go!

558
00:40:05,532 --> 00:40:06,408
You okay?
You okay, boy?

559
00:40:06,408 --> 00:40:07,159
Yeah.

560
00:40:07,618 --> 00:40:09,202
Okay. With me.
Ready? Ready?

561
00:40:09,328 --> 00:40:09,995
Yes, sir!

562
00:40:12,331 --> 00:40:13,332
Move!

563
00:40:17,961 --> 00:40:18,962
Come on!

564
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:28,680
Go, go, go!

565
00:40:29,556 --> 00:40:30,807
Flank out. Get after 'em!

566
00:40:38,065 --> 00:40:39,066
Spider?

567
00:40:42,402 --> 00:40:43,487
Spider!

568
00:40:43,654 --> 00:40:44,404
Kiri!

569
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:45,155
Spider.

570
00:40:45,697 --> 00:40:47,366
Come! Come on.

571
00:40:48,033 --> 00:40:49,701
Spider. He's
down there.

572
00:40:49,826 --> 00:40:50,452
No.

573
00:40:55,624 --> 00:40:56,833
Ma'am,
we're at bingo.

574
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,460
Ten minutes in enemy airspace.

575
00:40:59,586 --> 00:41:01,088
Blue One. Get back
to the rally point now.

576
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,346
<i>Blue One...</i>

577
00:41:09,471 --> 00:41:10,097
<i>fall back.</i>

578
00:41:10,472 --> 00:41:11,473
Fall back!

579
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,849
Fall back, fall back!

580
00:41:13,141 --> 00:41:14,142
Move out! Move!

581
00:41:15,018 --> 00:41:15,978
Move, move, move!

582
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:17,854
- Kiri!
- Spider!

583
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,147
Come, come.

584
00:41:19,273 --> 00:41:19,898
No.

585
00:41:19,898 --> 00:41:20,607
Come!

586
00:41:20,607 --> 00:41:21,775
Go, go, go.
Come on. Let's go.

587
00:41:24,569 --> 00:41:26,071
Hey. Hey, it's
okay. You hurt?

588
00:41:26,238 --> 00:41:27,197
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm okay.

589
00:41:27,364 --> 00:41:28,532
- Tuk, you hurt?
- Daddy!

590
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:49,803
Okay,
we're clear.

591
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,013
We're clear.
Everyone okay?

592
00:41:51,013 --> 00:41:52,472
- Mom!
- Tuk.

593
00:41:55,601 --> 00:41:57,894
It's okay. It's
okay. We're okay.

594
00:41:58,186 --> 00:42:00,063
Oh, thank you, Great
Mother. Thank you.

595
00:42:00,981 --> 00:42:01,940
Thank you.

596
00:42:02,566 --> 00:42:03,567
Where's Spider?

597
00:42:04,901 --> 00:42:05,902
They took him.

598
00:42:06,987 --> 00:42:07,988
They took him.

599
00:42:09,197 --> 00:42:10,532
Okay. It's all
right, baby girl.

600
00:42:10,657 --> 00:42:11,700
All right? He's
a tough kid.

601
00:42:12,576 --> 00:42:13,619
All right.

602
00:42:15,662 --> 00:42:16,663
He's gonna be okay.

603
00:42:18,498 --> 00:42:19,791
We're all gonna be okay.

604
00:42:29,801 --> 00:42:30,719
Goddamn!

605
00:42:30,844 --> 00:42:31,511
Come on!

606
00:42:36,183 --> 00:42:37,559
Let me out
of here!

607
00:42:45,984 --> 00:42:47,110
He's completely feral.

608
00:42:48,028 --> 00:42:49,071
Thinks he's
one of them.

609
00:42:53,408 --> 00:42:54,660
<i>This thing.
This Quaritch.</i>

610
00:42:54,826 --> 00:42:55,869
<i>Whatever he is...</i>

611
00:42:56,036 --> 00:42:57,079
- What's going on?
<i>- He can walk right in here.</i>

612
00:42:57,245 --> 00:42:58,789
<i>He can walk right
under Eywa's nose.</i>

613
00:42:58,956 --> 00:43:00,958
<i>- This is our family. This is our home.
- This is about our family.</i>

614
00:43:01,124 --> 00:43:02,459
<i>This is about
our little ones.</i>

615
00:43:03,752 --> 00:43:05,837
<i>I cannot. You cannot ask this.</i>

616
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:09,758
I cannot leave
my People.

617
00:43:11,009 --> 00:43:11,760
I will not.

618
00:43:12,302 --> 00:43:13,387
He's hunting us.

619
00:43:15,264 --> 00:43:16,390
He's targeting
our family.

620
00:43:16,515 --> 00:43:17,808
You cannot
ask this!

621
00:43:18,308 --> 00:43:21,103
The children. Everything they've
ever known. The forest.

622
00:43:21,561 --> 00:43:22,688
This is
our home!

623
00:43:22,854 --> 00:43:24,022
He had
our children.

624
00:43:24,189 --> 00:43:25,816
He had 'em
under his knife!

625
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,825
My father gave me...

626
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:37,160
this bow
as he lay dying.

627
00:43:37,327 --> 00:43:39,413
And he said
protect the People.

628
00:43:40,706 --> 00:43:42,332
You're
<i>Toruk Makto!</i>

629
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:45,168
<i>This will protect the People!</i>

630
00:43:45,627 --> 00:43:46,878
Quaritch
has Spider.

631
00:43:47,004 --> 00:43:48,213
And that kid
knows everything.

632
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,673
<i>He knows our
whole operation...</i>

633
00:43:49,798 --> 00:43:51,133
<i>and he can lead
them right in here.</i>

634
00:43:51,842 --> 00:43:54,344
If the People harbor
us, they will die.

635
00:43:55,929 --> 00:43:57,097
Do you
understand?

636
00:44:01,768 --> 00:44:02,894
Look, I
got nothing.

637
00:44:03,812 --> 00:44:04,980
I got
no plan...

638
00:44:07,232 --> 00:44:08,942
But I can protect this family.

639
00:44:09,067 --> 00:44:10,777
That I can do.

640
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:25,751
I know
one thing.

641
00:44:28,712 --> 00:44:29,922
Wherever we go...

642
00:44:30,047 --> 00:44:31,840
this family is our fortress.

643
00:44:45,729 --> 00:44:47,189
<i>Where is Jake Sully?</i>

644
00:44:47,356 --> 00:44:48,482
I don't know!

645
00:44:50,317 --> 00:44:51,526
We know that
you know.

646
00:44:52,361 --> 00:44:53,695
<i>I don't know!</i>

647
00:44:53,862 --> 00:44:54,738
<i>Just form a picture...</i>

648
00:44:54,863 --> 00:44:55,530
in your mind.

649
00:44:55,906 --> 00:44:57,407
Is it one of the
floating mountains?

650
00:44:58,325 --> 00:44:59,493
<i>Let me
out of here!</i>

651
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,119
He's fighting us.
Give us a minute.

652
00:45:01,286 --> 00:45:01,995
<i>I don't know!</i>

653
00:45:02,454 --> 00:45:04,623
Just form a thought,
and we will see it.

654
00:45:05,749 --> 00:45:07,084
<i>I don't know!</i>

655
00:45:07,793 --> 00:45:09,920
<i>Look, I don't like this
any more than you do.</i>

656
00:45:10,837 --> 00:45:12,506
Which clans would be harboring him?

657
00:45:12,506 --> 00:45:13,215
<i>I don't know!</i>

658
00:45:13,215 --> 00:45:14,549
You're gonna
have to kill me!

659
00:45:16,593 --> 00:45:17,219
Watch this.

660
00:45:17,344 --> 00:45:18,929
You're peaking all
over the prefrontal.

661
00:45:19,054 --> 00:45:20,138
It's not gonna stop...

662
00:45:20,264 --> 00:45:21,306
until you give
us something.

663
00:45:21,515 --> 00:45:22,808
<i>Where is he?</i>

664
00:45:23,433 --> 00:45:25,394
I don't know,
you buttholes! Okay?

665
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,812
I don't know!

666
00:45:40,117 --> 00:45:42,577
General, let me try
the personal angle.

667
00:45:47,124 --> 00:45:48,417
He's not your son.

668
00:46:20,032 --> 00:46:21,116
Easy, tiger.

669
00:46:21,283 --> 00:46:22,159
Easy.

670
00:46:31,043 --> 00:46:32,044
We good?

671
00:46:38,675 --> 00:46:39,801
Kid, you
got heart.

672
00:46:40,886 --> 00:46:43,263
<i>Those science pukes
leaned on you pretty hard.</i>

673
00:46:44,473 --> 00:46:45,974
But you gave
them nothin'.

674
00:46:48,143 --> 00:46:49,227
I respect that.

675
00:46:55,192 --> 00:46:56,777
I thought you
might want this.

676
00:47:05,202 --> 00:47:06,745
That's Colonel
Miles Quaritch.

677
00:47:07,537 --> 00:47:08,538
Deceased.

678
00:47:09,206 --> 00:47:10,374
Killed
in action.

679
00:47:16,088 --> 00:47:17,464
I'm not
that man.

680
00:47:18,882 --> 00:47:22,594
But I do have
his memories...

681
00:47:25,722 --> 00:47:27,140
<i>enough to
know that...</i>

682
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,018
well, he wasn't
always the best father.

683
00:47:31,895 --> 00:47:33,605
But that's
not an apology.

684
00:47:34,856 --> 00:47:37,150
I'm not your father. Technically...

685
00:47:37,317 --> 00:47:39,861
you and I, we're
nothin' to each other.

686
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,321
But...

687
00:47:42,364 --> 00:47:43,615
I can
help you.

688
00:47:44,616 --> 00:47:46,118
I can get you
outta here.

689
00:47:50,122 --> 00:47:52,374
I'm not gonna ask you
to betray Jake Sully.

690
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:54,584
I know you'd never
do that. You're loyal...

691
00:47:56,169 --> 00:47:57,504
and I
admire loyalty.

692
00:47:59,965 --> 00:48:01,300
Just ride along.

693
00:48:04,094 --> 00:48:06,805
Otherwise, I gotta give
you back to the lab coats.

694
00:48:16,023 --> 00:48:17,816
<i>This is like stones
in my heart.</i>

695
00:48:19,693 --> 00:48:22,362
<i>Tarsem is wise
for his years.</i>

696
00:48:22,529 --> 00:48:24,281
<i>He will be
a strong</i> Olo'eyktan.

697
00:48:26,325 --> 00:48:28,118
<i>The leader must die.</i>

698
00:48:32,414 --> 00:48:34,249
<i>So the leader
can be born.</i>

699
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:39,463
Toruk Makto
<i>will disappear.</i>

700
00:48:41,924 --> 00:48:43,508
<i>The People
will be safe.</i>

701
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,037
<i>A father protects.</i>

702
00:49:13,288 --> 00:49:14,998
<i>It's what gives
him meaning.</i>

703
00:49:19,253 --> 00:49:20,754
<i>One life ends.</i>

704
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,257
<i>Another begins.</i>

705
00:49:37,354 --> 00:49:38,355
Tuk.

706
00:49:42,484 --> 00:49:44,278
<i>The sea clans are a
world unto themselves.</i>

707
00:49:45,487 --> 00:49:47,030
<i>Thousands of islands.</i>

708
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:51,785
<i>An unknown territory into which
we could just vanish without a trace.</i>

709
00:49:52,536 --> 00:49:54,246
Are we there yet?

710
00:51:00,103 --> 00:51:01,021
Hey...

711
00:51:01,146 --> 00:51:01,772
leave it.

712
00:51:03,649 --> 00:51:04,650
On me.

713
00:51:06,818 --> 00:51:07,819
Tuk.

714
00:51:09,321 --> 00:51:10,322
Be nice.

715
00:51:12,324 --> 00:51:13,116
Be nice.

716
00:51:13,867 --> 00:51:14,868
Hey.

717
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:34,763
Easy.
Just be cool.

718
00:51:35,514 --> 00:51:36,640
Look.
What is that?

719
00:51:37,474 --> 00:51:38,725
Is that supposed
to be a tail?

720
00:51:56,326 --> 00:51:57,369
It's too small.

721
00:51:57,536 --> 00:51:58,537
How are they
supposed to swim?

722
00:51:58,704 --> 00:52:01,081
Do not.
Rotxo, Aonung.

723
00:52:03,792 --> 00:52:04,793
Hey.

724
00:52:29,693 --> 00:52:32,279
<i>Tonowari was the chief
of the</i> Metkayina...

725
00:52:32,821 --> 00:52:33,822
<i>the Reef People.</i>

726
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,033
I See you, Tonowari.

727
00:52:37,117 --> 00:52:38,285
Jakesully.

728
00:52:38,452 --> 00:52:39,786
<i>I knew him as
a tough leader.</i>

729
00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:46,460
<i>But it wasn't Tonowari
I was worried about.</i>

730
00:52:50,839 --> 00:52:52,424
I See you, Ronal.

731
00:52:52,591 --> 00:52:53,884
<i>Tsahik</i> of
the <i>Metkayina.</i>

732
00:52:54,051 --> 00:52:55,218
<i>I See you, Ronal.</i>

733
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,473
Why do you come
to us, Jakesully?

734
00:53:00,766 --> 00:53:01,850
We seek <i>uturu.</i>

735
00:53:04,144 --> 00:53:05,646
Yes, sanctuary
for my family.

736
00:53:08,774 --> 00:53:10,484
We are
Reef People.

737
00:53:10,651 --> 00:53:11,360
You are
Forest People.

738
00:53:11,902 --> 00:53:13,362
Your skills will
mean nothing here.

739
00:53:14,154 --> 00:53:16,406
Well, we will learn
your ways. Am I right?

740
00:53:16,573 --> 00:53:17,574
Yes.

741
00:53:20,953 --> 00:53:22,287
Their arms
are thin.

742
00:53:23,288 --> 00:53:24,122
Mom.

743
00:53:24,247 --> 00:53:25,040
Their tails...

744
00:53:25,374 --> 00:53:26,708
are weak.

745
00:53:26,875 --> 00:53:28,460
You will be
slow in the water.

746
00:53:31,713 --> 00:53:33,006
These children...

747
00:53:33,173 --> 00:53:35,008
- are not even true <i>Na'vi.</i>
- Dad.

748
00:53:36,969 --> 00:53:38,178
Yes, we are!

749
00:53:41,723 --> 00:53:43,141
They have
demon blood!

750
00:53:48,146 --> 00:53:49,439
Look. Look.

751
00:53:51,441 --> 00:53:53,485
Look, I was born of the Sky
People, and now I am <i>Na'vi.</i>

752
00:53:53,652 --> 00:53:54,945
All right?
You can adapt.

753
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:56,780
We will adapt.

754
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:57,739
Okay?

755
00:53:59,032 --> 00:54:01,118
My husband
was <i>Toruk Makto.</i>

756
00:54:02,995 --> 00:54:03,954
He led the clans to...

757
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,082
victory against the Sky People.

758
00:54:10,836 --> 00:54:12,045
This you
call victory?

759
00:54:13,213 --> 00:54:14,881
Hiding among
strangers?

760
00:54:19,177 --> 00:54:21,972
It seems Eywa has
turned her back on you...

761
00:54:22,097 --> 00:54:22,931
Chosen One.

762
00:54:29,021 --> 00:54:30,814
I apologize for
my mate. She's...

763
00:54:30,981 --> 00:54:32,399
Do not
apologize for me.

764
00:54:32,524 --> 00:54:33,775
...flown a long way,
and she's exhausted.

765
00:54:33,775 --> 00:54:34,693
Jake.

766
00:54:39,865 --> 00:54:42,451
<i>Toruk Makto</i> is a
great war leader.

767
00:54:43,285 --> 00:54:45,954
All <i>Na'vi</i> people know his story.

768
00:54:46,121 --> 00:54:47,497
But we <i>Metkayina...</i>

769
00:54:47,664 --> 00:54:49,082
- Dad.
- ...are not at war.

770
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,713
We cannot let you
bring your war here.

771
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,757
I'm done
with war.

772
00:54:56,924 --> 00:54:57,925
Okay?

773
00:54:58,508 --> 00:55:00,427
I just want to keep
my family safe.

774
00:55:04,932 --> 00:55:06,934
<i>Uturu</i> has
been asked.

775
00:55:11,855 --> 00:55:12,981
<i>Do we have to go?</i>

776
00:55:13,774 --> 00:55:14,775
We'll be okay.

777
00:55:27,496 --> 00:55:29,998
<i>Toruk Makto</i> and his
family will stay with us.

778
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:33,543
Treat them as our
brothers and sisters.

779
00:55:35,003 --> 00:55:36,838
Now, they do not
know the sea.

780
00:55:37,714 --> 00:55:39,466
So they will be
like babies...

781
00:55:40,259 --> 00:55:41,134
taking their...

782
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:42,261
<i>first breath.</i>

783
00:55:42,928 --> 00:55:47,140
Teach them our ways, so they
do not suffer the shame of being...

784
00:55:47,266 --> 00:55:48,600
useless.

785
00:55:50,769 --> 00:55:51,520
Okay, what
do we say?

786
00:55:51,645 --> 00:55:52,729
Thank you.

787
00:55:52,854 --> 00:55:53,772
<i>Thank you.</i>

788
00:55:54,106 --> 00:55:55,107
Thank you.

789
00:55:55,649 --> 00:55:59,319
My son, Aonung, our daughter, Tsireya,
will show your children what to do.

790
00:55:59,695 --> 00:56:01,321
- Father, why do...
- It is decided.

791
00:56:02,197 --> 00:56:04,866
Come. I will show
you our village.

792
00:56:15,419 --> 00:56:16,420
This way.

793
00:56:19,756 --> 00:56:21,300
Tuk, let's go.

794
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,843
Just up here.

795
00:56:31,476 --> 00:56:32,728
This is for you.

796
00:56:33,478 --> 00:56:34,479
Your new home.

797
00:56:35,856 --> 00:56:36,857
Yeah, this will work.

798
00:56:37,858 --> 00:56:38,942
This is great.

799
00:56:39,109 --> 00:56:40,110
It's nice, right?

800
00:56:53,665 --> 00:56:54,791
Okay, Sullys, fall in.

801
00:56:54,958 --> 00:56:55,751
Remember?

802
00:56:55,876 --> 00:56:56,710
Family
meeting.

803
00:56:56,877 --> 00:56:57,878
<i>Come on. Take
a knee. Let's go.</i>

804
00:56:58,045 --> 00:56:58,921
Kiri.

805
00:56:59,338 --> 00:57:00,339
What?

806
00:57:00,505 --> 00:57:02,090
<i>Okay.</i>

807
00:57:02,257 --> 00:57:03,926
I need
you kids

808
00:57:04,051 --> 00:57:05,719
on your best behavior.

809
00:57:05,886 --> 00:57:07,387
I mean it.

810
00:57:07,554 --> 00:57:09,014
Learn fast.
Pull your weight.

811
00:57:10,057 --> 00:57:12,351
Don't cause trouble.
You got it?

812
00:57:12,517 --> 00:57:13,769
Yes, sir.

813
00:57:16,229 --> 00:57:17,981
I want to
go home.

814
00:57:19,942 --> 00:57:21,568
Oh, Tuk.

815
00:57:22,194 --> 00:57:25,572
Tuk, this is
our home now.

816
00:57:26,949 --> 00:57:30,369
Now we're gonna
get through this.

817
00:57:30,535 --> 00:57:31,495
We're gonna
get through this

818
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,455
if we have each
other's backs. All right?

819
00:57:33,622 --> 00:57:35,624
What does your
father always say?

820
00:57:36,249 --> 00:57:38,669
Sullys stick together.

821
00:57:38,835 --> 00:57:41,046
<i>That's right.
Sullys stick together.</i>

822
00:57:41,213 --> 00:57:42,839
Now this time
with some feeling.

823
00:57:43,006 --> 00:57:44,341
Yeah.

824
00:57:44,508 --> 00:57:45,300
Sullys stick together.

825
00:57:45,467 --> 00:57:46,760
Sullys stick together.

826
00:57:47,302 --> 00:57:48,679
Sullys stick together.

827
00:57:59,273 --> 00:58:00,274
Come on.

828
01:00:32,384 --> 01:00:33,760
Are you all right?

829
01:00:33,927 --> 01:00:34,595
You're too fast!

830
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,263
Wait for us.

831
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,265
Just breathe.

832
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:39,349
Breathe.

833
01:00:39,516 --> 01:00:40,642
You are not
good divers.

834
01:00:41,351 --> 01:00:43,604
Maybe good at swinging
through trees, but...

835
01:00:44,187 --> 01:00:45,188
Come on, bro.

836
01:00:45,355 --> 01:00:47,357
We don't speak this
finger talk, guys.

837
01:00:47,482 --> 01:00:48,483
We don't know
what you're saying.

838
01:00:48,942 --> 01:00:49,943
I will teach you.

839
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:51,445
<i>- Where is Kiri?
- Kiri?</i>

840
01:00:51,612 --> 01:00:52,613
- Who?
- Kiri.

841
01:00:52,779 --> 01:00:53,780
Where is Kiri?

842
01:00:53,947 --> 01:00:55,198
<i>Did you see her?</i>

843
01:01:05,792 --> 01:01:07,294
Get on the ship...

844
01:01:07,461 --> 01:01:08,962
find a seat, and
keep out of the way.

845
01:01:10,631 --> 01:01:11,506
Let's go!

846
01:01:12,341 --> 01:01:13,300
Chop-chop.

847
01:01:13,425 --> 01:01:14,259
Sweet.

848
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:16,887
Whoa, hold on
there, hotshot!

849
01:01:18,096 --> 01:01:19,097
You listen up.

850
01:01:20,349 --> 01:01:22,559
There's a tracker
built in that mask.

851
01:01:22,726 --> 01:01:24,728
We hit the ground,
and you take off...

852
01:01:24,895 --> 01:01:27,064
I'll have you back
in two minutes...

853
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:29,816
and I will give you a
old-school ass-whippin'.

854
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:30,984
Understood?

855
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:33,236
Understood?

856
01:01:33,737 --> 01:01:34,905
Yes, sir.

857
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,281
We up?

858
01:01:36,448 --> 01:01:37,449
Team's up.

859
01:01:52,005 --> 01:01:53,131
All right,
listen up.

860
01:01:54,508 --> 01:01:56,718
Jake Sully's
gone to ground.

861
01:01:57,219 --> 01:01:58,220
Don't
matter.

862
01:01:58,387 --> 01:01:59,763
Wherever he is,
we'll find him...

863
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:02,683
and his batshit
crazy wife, too.

864
01:02:04,309 --> 01:02:05,560
To do so...

865
01:02:05,686 --> 01:02:07,938
we go <i>Na'vi</i>.

866
01:02:08,105 --> 01:02:09,439
Full tilt,
all the way.

867
01:02:09,606 --> 01:02:10,232
That means we...

868
01:02:10,232 --> 01:02:13,860
eat <i>Na'vi.</i>
We ride <i>Na'vi.</i>

869
01:02:14,027 --> 01:02:15,862
Think <i>Na'vi.</i>

870
01:02:31,503 --> 01:02:32,713
All right, smart guy.

871
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:36,049
You just went from bein'
our monkey mascot...

872
01:02:36,174 --> 01:02:37,801
to official interpreter.

873
01:02:45,058 --> 01:02:46,560
These are <i>ilu.</i>

874
01:02:47,019 --> 01:02:48,604
If you want
to live here...

875
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:50,022
you have to ride.

876
01:02:51,023 --> 01:02:52,357
Make the
bond gently.

877
01:02:57,863 --> 01:02:59,573
Feel his breath.

878
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:01,199
<i>Feel his strength.</i>

879
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:04,411
Hold here.

880
01:03:06,997 --> 01:03:08,123
Hold on.

881
01:03:27,726 --> 01:03:28,518
<i>You all right...</i>

882
01:03:28,644 --> 01:03:29,686
<i>Forest Boy?</i>

883
01:03:39,696 --> 01:03:41,239
This is a
warrior's mount.

884
01:03:41,406 --> 01:03:42,741
Not easy
to master.

885
01:03:42,908 --> 01:03:45,410
Perhaps
you should...

886
01:03:45,577 --> 01:03:46,620
start with
an <i>ilu.</i>

887
01:03:47,162 --> 01:03:48,246
Nah.
This one.

888
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:52,834
<i>Now remember...</i>

889
01:03:53,335 --> 01:03:55,629
when you dive back
in, good position.

890
01:03:55,796 --> 01:03:56,797
Very important.

891
01:04:00,425 --> 01:04:01,426
I got this.

892
01:04:28,161 --> 01:04:29,371
That's it, okay.

893
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:31,581
Steady.

894
01:04:46,054 --> 01:04:47,347
Ah, shit.

895
01:05:18,086 --> 01:05:19,838
I love her already.

896
01:06:00,003 --> 01:06:01,046
Breathe in.

897
01:06:04,299 --> 01:06:05,884
And breathe out.

898
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:09,137
Imagine flickering
a flame.

899
01:06:11,223 --> 01:06:14,226
You must slow down
your heartbeat.

900
01:06:15,769 --> 01:06:16,770
Breathe in.

901
01:06:18,063 --> 01:06:20,232
Breathe from
down here.

902
01:06:21,733 --> 01:06:23,694
Breathe out slowly.

903
01:06:25,862 --> 01:06:28,407
Lo'ak, your
heartbeat is fast.

904
01:06:28,573 --> 01:06:30,200
- Sorry.
- Try to focus.

905
01:06:30,367 --> 01:06:31,827
- Okay.
- Breathe in.

906
01:06:33,912 --> 01:06:35,580
<i>And breathe out.</i>

907
01:06:35,747 --> 01:06:37,291
<i>Let your mind go clear.</i>

908
01:06:56,101 --> 01:06:58,228
You are learning
to breathe.

909
01:07:03,817 --> 01:07:05,694
Come on!
Keep up, losers!

910
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:21,251
I got this.

911
01:07:28,133 --> 01:07:29,176
What?

912
01:07:29,343 --> 01:07:32,137
<i>Na'vi</i> kids younger than me
do this with their bare hands.

913
01:07:34,389 --> 01:07:36,391
Jake Sully did it
the hard way?

914
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:38,310
What do
you think?

915
01:07:41,855 --> 01:07:42,940
What are we
doin', Colonel?

916
01:07:47,986 --> 01:07:49,029
This is gonna
be good.

917
01:07:52,407 --> 01:07:53,617
All right, move up.

918
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:02,584
It's you and me, cupcake.

919
01:08:16,139 --> 01:08:18,308
Did I mention you're
supposed to tie the mouth shut first?

920
01:08:19,434 --> 01:08:20,685
Thanks a lot, kid!

921
01:08:25,649 --> 01:08:26,274
Move up,
move up!

922
01:08:34,783 --> 01:08:35,783
You see 'em?

923
01:08:58,098 --> 01:08:59,808
All right, let's go.
We're Oscar Mike.

924
01:08:59,933 --> 01:09:00,559
Come on.

925
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:05,147
Let's go.
We're outta here.

926
01:09:11,236 --> 01:09:12,237
Yeah!

927
01:09:12,696 --> 01:09:13,822
That's right!

928
01:09:16,408 --> 01:09:17,993
Yeah, Colonel!
Get some!

929
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,118
Yeah, Colonel!

930
01:09:19,286 --> 01:09:20,537
Who's up next?

931
01:09:29,254 --> 01:09:32,841
The way of water has
no beginning and no end.

932
01:09:37,511 --> 01:09:39,555
<i>The sea is around you...</i>

933
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:40,849
<i>and in you.</i>

934
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:49,942
<i>The sea is your home...</i>

935
01:09:50,567 --> 01:09:52,361
<i>before your birth...</i>

936
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:55,155
<i>and after your death.</i>

937
01:10:00,869 --> 01:10:04,456
<i>Our hearts beat in
the womb of the world.</i>

938
01:10:06,917 --> 01:10:11,255
<i>Our breath burns
in the shadows of the deep.</i>

939
01:10:12,589 --> 01:10:14,424
<i>The sea gives...</i>

940
01:10:15,801 --> 01:10:17,594
<i>and the sea takes.</i>

941
01:10:20,597 --> 01:10:23,517
<i>Water connects all things.</i>

942
01:10:25,686 --> 01:10:27,521
<i>Life to death.</i>

943
01:10:29,690 --> 01:10:30,691
<i>Darkness...</i>

944
01:10:32,359 --> 01:10:33,151
<i>to light.</i>

945
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:35,946
I got it!

946
01:10:37,197 --> 01:10:37,906
You did it!

947
01:11:41,303 --> 01:11:42,304
What is
she doing?

948
01:11:43,055 --> 01:11:44,056
<i>I don't know.</i>

949
01:11:44,222 --> 01:11:45,807
She's just looking
at the sand.

950
01:11:48,518 --> 01:11:49,686
What'd you say?

951
01:11:50,062 --> 01:11:52,689
Are you some
kind of... freak?

952
01:11:53,523 --> 01:11:54,983
He asked if
you are a freak.

953
01:11:58,362 --> 01:11:58,987
No.

954
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:00,906
Are you sure?

955
01:12:01,073 --> 01:12:02,616
I mean, you're
not even real <i>Na'vi.</i>

956
01:12:03,325 --> 01:12:04,660
Look at
these hands.

957
01:12:04,952 --> 01:12:06,078
I mean,
look at them...

958
01:12:06,912 --> 01:12:07,913
Hey!

959
01:12:08,413 --> 01:12:09,790
Back off,
fishlips!

960
01:12:09,957 --> 01:12:12,209
Oh, another
four-fingered freak.

961
01:12:12,376 --> 01:12:13,543
Look at his
little baby tail!

962
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:14,711
Don't
touch me!

963
01:12:14,836 --> 01:12:15,462
Baby tail!

964
01:12:15,587 --> 01:12:16,797
Leave us alone!

965
01:12:17,214 --> 01:12:18,090
He's not normal.

966
01:12:18,423 --> 01:12:19,258
<i>Look at his tail.</i>

967
01:12:19,383 --> 01:12:20,133
Aw, baby tail!

968
01:12:20,384 --> 01:12:21,551
It is so cute!

969
01:12:22,970 --> 01:12:24,096
You heard
what she said.

970
01:12:25,055 --> 01:12:26,265
Leave
them alone.

971
01:12:26,765 --> 01:12:27,891
Ah, big
brother come...

972
01:12:29,142 --> 01:12:30,477
Back off.

973
01:12:31,603 --> 01:12:32,771
Now.

974
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:39,987
Smart choice.

975
01:12:40,404 --> 01:12:41,822
And from
now on...

976
01:12:41,989 --> 01:12:43,991
I need you to
respect my sister.

977
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:48,996
<i>Let's go.</i>

978
01:12:52,249 --> 01:12:53,667
Buh-bye!

979
01:12:54,001 --> 01:12:55,002
Look at them.

980
01:12:55,168 --> 01:12:56,169
They're all freaks.

981
01:12:56,336 --> 01:12:57,337
The whole family.

982
01:12:59,631 --> 01:13:00,632
Lo'ak.

983
01:13:00,799 --> 01:13:01,800
I got this, bro.

984
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:06,888
I know this
hand is funny.

985
01:13:07,055 --> 01:13:09,641
Look, I'm a freak.
An alien.

986
01:13:11,018 --> 01:13:12,811
But it can do
something really cool.

987
01:13:12,978 --> 01:13:13,979
Watch.

988
01:13:14,146 --> 01:13:16,481
First, I ball it up
real tight like this.

989
01:13:16,648 --> 01:13:17,774
Okay? Then...

990
01:13:21,987 --> 01:13:23,030
It's called a
punch, bitch!

991
01:13:23,196 --> 01:13:24,531
Don't ever touch
my sister again.

992
01:13:26,116 --> 01:13:27,743
Yeah! Aonung!
Show him!

993
01:13:29,745 --> 01:13:30,746
Come here!

994
01:13:31,955 --> 01:13:32,956
Hey!
Hey!

995
01:13:37,419 --> 01:13:38,754
<i>Stop this!</i>

996
01:13:39,671 --> 01:13:40,672
Stop it!

997
01:13:42,925 --> 01:13:44,051
So stupid!

998
01:13:47,429 --> 01:13:48,430
Ow, my tail!

999
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:52,476
My ear!
Let go!

1000
01:13:52,809 --> 01:13:54,978
<i>He's got my ear!</i>

1001
01:13:59,858 --> 01:14:01,693
What was the
one thing I asked?

1002
01:14:01,818 --> 01:14:02,444
The one thing!

1003
01:14:02,569 --> 01:14:03,779
- Stay out of trouble.
- Stay out of trouble.

1004
01:14:03,946 --> 01:14:04,947
- Right.
- It was my fault.

1005
01:14:05,113 --> 01:14:05,781
I don't think so.

1006
01:14:05,906 --> 01:14:07,491
You gotta stop takin' the
heat for this knucklehead.

1007
01:14:07,658 --> 01:14:09,409
Look, Dad. Aonung
was picking on Kiri.

1008
01:14:10,118 --> 01:14:11,119
He called
her a freak.

1009
01:14:15,207 --> 01:14:16,416
Go apologize
to Aonung.

1010
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,876
What?

1011
01:14:18,043 --> 01:14:19,962
<i>He is the chief's son.
Do you understand?</i>

1012
01:14:20,921 --> 01:14:22,631
I don't care how you do it.
Just go make peace.

1013
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:24,091
Just go.

1014
01:14:29,263 --> 01:14:30,264
Hey.

1015
01:14:32,224 --> 01:14:33,558
So what'd the
other guys look like?

1016
01:14:34,393 --> 01:14:35,435
Worse.

1017
01:14:36,103 --> 01:14:37,104
That's good.

1018
01:14:37,688 --> 01:14:38,689
A lot worse.

1019
01:14:38,981 --> 01:14:40,190
Get outta here.

1020
01:14:51,785 --> 01:14:52,869
What is wrong?

1021
01:14:54,871 --> 01:14:56,665
Nothing. I'm fine.

1022
01:14:57,833 --> 01:14:59,668
Why should I not be fine?

1023
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:09,344
Why can't I just be
like everyone else?

1024
01:15:11,555 --> 01:15:12,723
Oh, Kiri.

1025
01:15:16,268 --> 01:15:18,645
Ah, what's tree
boy doing here?

1026
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:23,025
I'm sorry
I hit you.

1027
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:25,068
So many times.

1028
01:15:31,575 --> 01:15:33,076
We should
be friends.

1029
01:15:35,704 --> 01:15:36,705
Come hunting with us.

1030
01:15:37,414 --> 01:15:38,540
Outside
the reef.

1031
01:15:39,374 --> 01:15:40,876
It's where
the men hunt.

1032
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:43,045
No way.
I'm not allowed.

1033
01:15:44,212 --> 01:15:46,048
I must be asking
the wrong brother.

1034
01:15:47,215 --> 01:15:47,966
Let's do it.

1035
01:16:03,148 --> 01:16:04,733
Come on! Come on!

1036
01:16:05,692 --> 01:16:06,693
Yeah!

1037
01:16:14,618 --> 01:16:16,078
Keep up, Forest Boy!

1038
01:16:17,621 --> 01:16:18,455
Yeah!

1039
01:16:31,385 --> 01:16:32,886
Hey, you lived!

1040
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:34,972
That was
insane, cuz!

1041
01:16:36,139 --> 01:16:37,140
This way.

1042
01:16:37,266 --> 01:16:38,225
I know a
good spot.

1043
01:17:30,611 --> 01:17:31,612
Hey, guys!

1044
01:17:32,362 --> 01:17:33,363
Hey!

1045
01:17:35,949 --> 01:17:36,950
Aonung!

1046
01:17:38,493 --> 01:17:39,870
Come on, this isn't funny!

1047
01:17:52,049 --> 01:17:53,050
Hey,
Aonung!

1048
01:21:27,973 --> 01:21:28,890
Holy shit.

1049
01:21:58,295 --> 01:21:59,296
You're a <i>tulkun.</i>

1050
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:04,092
You saved my life.

1051
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:05,761
Thank you.

1052
01:22:07,179 --> 01:22:08,180
Thank you.

1053
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:17,022
Buddy, I have no idea
what you just said.

1054
01:22:24,029 --> 01:22:25,614
They hurt you, didn't they?

1055
01:22:27,991 --> 01:22:29,242
I'll try to
pull it out.

1056
01:22:30,786 --> 01:22:31,912
Just trust me, okay?

1057
01:23:06,989 --> 01:23:07,990
Friends?

1058
01:23:11,618 --> 01:23:13,870
That's right, we're
friends. Friends.

1059
01:23:18,709 --> 01:23:19,376
Bro!

1060
01:25:11,488 --> 01:25:13,115
So, what is it,
baby girl?

1061
01:25:14,449 --> 01:25:15,575
You missin'
Spider?

1062
01:25:18,996 --> 01:25:19,997
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1063
01:25:21,123 --> 01:25:22,374
But that's
not it.

1064
01:25:24,918 --> 01:25:25,877
Okay...

1065
01:25:27,754 --> 01:25:28,755
So what is it?

1066
01:25:29,965 --> 01:25:31,300
I feel her, Dad.

1067
01:25:33,969 --> 01:25:34,970
You feel who?

1068
01:25:35,721 --> 01:25:36,722
Eywa.

1069
01:25:41,435 --> 01:25:42,936
I hear her breathing.

1070
01:25:44,313 --> 01:25:45,814
I hear her heartbeat.

1071
01:25:47,274 --> 01:25:48,650
She's so close.

1072
01:25:49,901 --> 01:25:52,112
She's just there...

1073
01:25:54,072 --> 01:25:55,866
like a word about
to be spoken.

1074
01:26:01,830 --> 01:26:03,665
I know you think I'm crazy.

1075
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:08,420
You're not crazy,
baby girl.

1076
01:26:12,841 --> 01:26:15,177
So what does Eywa's
heartbeat sound like?

1077
01:26:20,265 --> 01:26:21,558
Mighty.

1078
01:26:29,274 --> 01:26:30,734
Tell him what
you told me!

1079
01:26:36,531 --> 01:26:38,116
You like lookin' at the stars?

1080
01:26:41,453 --> 01:26:43,205
You know, my dad
came from a star.

1081
01:26:44,748 --> 01:26:45,707
That one.

1082
01:26:45,832 --> 01:26:46,458
Right there.

1083
01:26:50,003 --> 01:26:51,004
Lo'ak!

1084
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:52,756
Oh, man.
I'm in trouble.

1085
01:26:55,676 --> 01:26:56,385
Go.

1086
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:57,511
I will see
you again.

1087
01:27:16,196 --> 01:27:18,240
- The boy has returned!
- It is the Sully boy.

1088
01:27:18,365 --> 01:27:19,908
- They found the boy.
- They found him.

1089
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:26,581
Hey, hey.

1090
01:27:28,917 --> 01:27:30,043
Let's have a
look at you. Okay.

1091
01:27:31,628 --> 01:27:32,921
<i>He's fine.
He's fine...</i>

1092
01:27:32,921 --> 01:27:33,630
yeah.

1093
01:27:33,630 --> 01:27:35,007
Just a few scratches.

1094
01:27:38,051 --> 01:27:39,553
I pray for the strength
that I will not...

1095
01:27:39,678 --> 01:27:41,597
pluck the eyeballs out
of my youngest son!

1096
01:27:43,265 --> 01:27:44,266
<i>No.</i>

1097
01:27:44,725 --> 01:27:47,311
My son knows better
than to take him outside the reef.

1098
01:27:49,771 --> 01:27:51,481
The blame is his.

1099
01:27:52,774 --> 01:27:54,192
Okay,
let's go.

1100
01:27:54,693 --> 01:27:55,694
No.

1101
01:27:56,153 --> 01:27:57,362
This is not
Aonung's fault.

1102
01:27:58,113 --> 01:27:59,364
<i>This was my idea.</i>

1103
01:27:59,531 --> 01:28:01,033
Aonung tried to
talk me out of it.

1104
01:28:01,992 --> 01:28:02,993
Really.

1105
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:04,286
<i>Come on.</i>

1106
01:28:05,912 --> 01:28:06,955
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1107
01:28:07,706 --> 01:28:08,332
Come on.

1108
01:28:11,668 --> 01:28:12,669
I got this.

1109
01:28:15,923 --> 01:28:17,466
Is this true?

1110
01:28:17,591 --> 01:28:19,635
Aonung. What
were you thinking?

1111
01:28:22,888 --> 01:28:24,848
Dad, you told me to make
friends with these kids.

1112
01:28:25,015 --> 01:28:26,850
- That's all I was trying to...
- I don't want to hear it.

1113
01:28:27,017 --> 01:28:28,018
Dad...

1114
01:28:28,185 --> 01:28:29,686
You brought shame
to this family.

1115
01:28:32,981 --> 01:28:34,107
Can I go now?

1116
01:28:34,650 --> 01:28:36,276
Any more trouble, I
jerk a knot in your tail.

1117
01:28:36,401 --> 01:28:37,527
You read me?

1118
01:28:38,070 --> 01:28:39,988
Yes, sir.
Lima Charlie.

1119
01:28:50,707 --> 01:28:51,917
Where
were you?

1120
01:28:52,084 --> 01:28:53,043
Yeah.

1121
01:28:53,168 --> 01:28:55,045
What happened to "keep
an eye on your brother"?

1122
01:28:55,712 --> 01:28:56,713
Sorry, sir.

1123
01:29:01,343 --> 01:29:02,928
Why did you
speak for me?

1124
01:29:03,637 --> 01:29:04,888
Because I know
what it's like...

1125
01:29:05,055 --> 01:29:06,390
to be one big disappointment.

1126
01:29:10,018 --> 01:29:11,895
I wish I'd
been there.

1127
01:29:12,062 --> 01:29:13,981
The ocean blessed
you with a gift, brother.

1128
01:29:14,648 --> 01:29:16,984
The <i>tulkun</i> have not returned yet.

1129
01:29:17,150 --> 01:29:19,111
And anyway, no <i>tulkun</i> is ever alone.

1130
01:29:19,903 --> 01:29:20,988
Well, this one was.

1131
01:29:21,905 --> 01:29:23,740
He had a
missing fin.

1132
01:29:23,907 --> 01:29:24,825
Like a stump.

1133
01:29:24,950 --> 01:29:25,575
On the
left side.

1134
01:29:25,575 --> 01:29:26,785
Poor <i>tulkun.</i>

1135
01:29:27,494 --> 01:29:28,495
Payakan.

1136
01:29:30,497 --> 01:29:31,373
Who's Payakan?

1137
01:29:32,165 --> 01:29:33,834
A young bull
who went rogue.

1138
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:35,586
He's outcast. Alone.

1139
01:29:36,128 --> 01:29:37,254
And he has a missing fin.

1140
01:29:37,504 --> 01:29:38,922
They say
he is a killer.

1141
01:29:39,089 --> 01:29:40,966
- No, no.
- He killed <i>Na'vi...</i>

1142
01:29:41,091 --> 01:29:43,010
and other <i>tulkun.</i>

1143
01:29:44,469 --> 01:29:45,345
Not here...

1144
01:29:45,470 --> 01:29:46,263
but far to the south.

1145
01:29:46,430 --> 01:29:47,139
No, he's no killer.

1146
01:29:49,141 --> 01:29:50,642
You are lucky to be alive.

1147
01:29:50,809 --> 01:29:52,144
I'm telling you guys.

1148
01:29:52,269 --> 01:29:53,353
He saved my life.

1149
01:29:54,062 --> 01:29:55,147
He's my friend.

1150
01:29:55,772 --> 01:29:56,940
My baby
bro!

1151
01:29:57,107 --> 01:29:58,150
The Mighty Warrior...

1152
01:29:58,734 --> 01:29:59,943
who faced the killer <i>tulkun...</i>

1153
01:29:59,943 --> 01:30:00,861
and lived to tell about it, huh?

1154
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:04,364
You guys
aren't listening.

1155
01:30:05,407 --> 01:30:08,368
<i>- Lo'ak, I'm listening.
- Lo'ak, come back.</i>

1156
01:30:08,535 --> 01:30:09,828
<i>You</i> skxawngs.

1157
01:30:10,954 --> 01:30:11,580
Payakan!

1158
01:30:14,041 --> 01:30:14,708
Payakan!

1159
01:30:17,502 --> 01:30:18,337
Payakan!

1160
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:28,138
It's good
to see you.

1161
01:30:31,558 --> 01:30:33,185
Why are
you outcast?

1162
01:30:33,352 --> 01:30:34,353
What happened?

1163
01:30:40,067 --> 01:30:42,319
I trust you.

1164
01:30:43,028 --> 01:30:45,155
You can trust me.

1165
01:31:30,951 --> 01:31:32,160
Bro, that's
disgusting!

1166
01:32:13,785 --> 01:32:14,995
We are here.

1167
01:32:21,627 --> 01:32:23,754
This is the Cove
of the Ancestors.

1168
01:32:23,921 --> 01:32:25,464
Our most
sacred place.

1169
01:32:32,554 --> 01:32:35,515
<i>Eclipse is the best
time of day to be here.</i>

1170
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:49,821
This is it.

1171
01:32:50,405 --> 01:32:51,740
This is the Spirit Tree.

1172
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:00,100
My beautiful daughter.

1173
01:34:01,602 --> 01:34:02,603
Hi, Ma.

1174
01:34:03,562 --> 01:34:04,813
I'm so happy
to see you.

1175
01:34:05,939 --> 01:34:06,940
But you
look troubled.

1176
01:34:13,405 --> 01:34:14,406
My sweet girl.

1177
01:34:15,282 --> 01:34:16,658
It will be okay.

1178
01:34:24,207 --> 01:34:25,375
What is it, baby?

1179
01:34:26,793 --> 01:34:28,128
Why am I
different?

1180
01:34:30,797 --> 01:34:33,008
What does the Great
Mother want from me?

1181
01:34:36,637 --> 01:34:38,597
Who was
my father?

1182
01:34:42,726 --> 01:34:44,311
Oh, my darling.

1183
01:34:49,066 --> 01:34:50,317
No!

1184
01:35:08,543 --> 01:35:09,628
Come on.

1185
01:35:15,634 --> 01:35:16,969
What is wrong?
What is it?

1186
01:35:17,761 --> 01:35:18,845
It was a seizure.

1187
01:35:19,471 --> 01:35:20,472
Is she breathing?

1188
01:35:20,973 --> 01:35:22,099
Is she
breathing?

1189
01:35:25,644 --> 01:35:26,812
Get her
to the village!

1190
01:35:26,937 --> 01:35:27,562
Hurry!

1191
01:35:27,688 --> 01:35:28,939
Let's go!
Let's move!

1192
01:35:29,064 --> 01:35:29,731
Tuk, come.

1193
01:35:44,913 --> 01:35:46,164
- Hi!
- It's good to see you.

1194
01:35:46,331 --> 01:35:47,457
Let's get the gear.
Neteyam!

1195
01:35:47,624 --> 01:35:48,667
Neteyam, keep
them back!

1196
01:35:48,834 --> 01:35:49,626
How is she?

1197
01:35:49,793 --> 01:35:50,919
She's still unconscious.

1198
01:35:51,878 --> 01:35:53,046
There's no bleed.

1199
01:35:53,171 --> 01:35:54,256
There's no fracture.

1200
01:35:55,299 --> 01:35:56,883
No effects of hypoxia.

1201
01:35:57,050 --> 01:35:58,176
The brain looks good.

1202
01:36:02,848 --> 01:36:05,809
But we still have this interictal
activity right here in the prefrontal.

1203
01:36:05,976 --> 01:36:07,769
- Okay.
- She's definitely had a seizure.

1204
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:10,188
- I think we can rule out toxins.
- So what is it?

1205
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:12,983
I see that I am
not needed here.

1206
01:36:13,650 --> 01:36:15,068
You are <i>Tsahik!</i>

1207
01:36:17,029 --> 01:36:18,322
Remove
these things.

1208
01:36:19,156 --> 01:36:20,157
Out!

1209
01:36:20,282 --> 01:36:20,991
You have
done nothing!

1210
01:36:21,158 --> 01:36:22,659
Come on, come on.
Let's just take a break.

1211
01:36:23,452 --> 01:36:24,870
Okay, hold on.
I gotta take her IV off.

1212
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:27,581
Tuktirey.

1213
01:36:36,089 --> 01:36:39,301
She said that she can feel Eywa.
She can hear her heartbeat.

1214
01:36:39,468 --> 01:36:40,594
- That's it.
- What?

1215
01:36:40,761 --> 01:36:42,971
That is classic
frontal lobe epilepsy.

1216
01:36:43,597 --> 01:36:44,598
- Epilepsy?
- Yep.

1217
01:36:44,765 --> 01:36:46,808
You see visions.
You get...

1218
01:36:46,975 --> 01:36:49,311
states of religious ecstasy
like the kind she's describing.

1219
01:36:57,527 --> 01:37:00,948
Pluggin' into the Spirit Tree
is some sort of a trigger.

1220
01:37:01,114 --> 01:37:02,908
You definitely can't let
her do that anymore.

1221
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:06,203
What? Ever?

1222
01:37:06,370 --> 01:37:07,371
Jake.

1223
01:37:07,913 --> 01:37:09,748
If she seizes
underwater again...

1224
01:37:10,499 --> 01:37:11,708
it could kill her.

1225
01:37:24,096 --> 01:37:25,097
You're awake!

1226
01:37:34,106 --> 01:37:35,607
Kiri, my sweet child.

1227
01:37:36,441 --> 01:37:37,985
Oh, my sweet little girl.

1228
01:37:38,735 --> 01:37:39,736
Okay, this one.

1229
01:37:39,861 --> 01:37:40,737
"I See you."

1230
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:48,412
That's what I
just said, isn't it?

1231
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:53,041
Not <i>"Naati. Ngaati."</i>

1232
01:37:54,167 --> 01:37:56,420
All right. Like comin'
out your nose or something.

1233
01:37:57,337 --> 01:37:58,338
<i>Boss...</i>

1234
01:37:59,047 --> 01:38:00,924
long-range patrol
picked up a radar hit.

1235
01:38:01,091 --> 01:38:02,384
A rogue gunship.

1236
01:38:03,385 --> 01:38:04,386
Where?

1237
01:38:04,553 --> 01:38:06,138
<i>Eastern sea.
Four hundred klicks north.</i>

1238
01:38:09,099 --> 01:38:10,100
Hang on.

1239
01:38:12,728 --> 01:38:16,857
The signal was intermittent,
and they lost it over open water but...

1240
01:38:17,482 --> 01:38:18,942
if you project the track...

1241
01:38:20,277 --> 01:38:22,029
it hits this island group.

1242
01:38:23,196 --> 01:38:25,073
That's hundreds
of islands.

1243
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:27,326
That's a big search box
with lots of villages.

1244
01:38:27,492 --> 01:38:28,577
This is our guy.

1245
01:38:29,411 --> 01:38:32,497
You give me ships and aircraft,
I'll bring you back his scalp.

1246
01:38:44,551 --> 01:38:45,677
Bogies inbound.

1247
01:38:45,802 --> 01:38:46,511
Skipper.

1248
01:38:54,853 --> 01:38:56,396
- All stop.
- All stop.

1249
01:38:56,563 --> 01:38:57,814
All stop. Aye.

1250
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:17,793
Hey.

1251
01:39:18,293 --> 01:39:19,503
You Scoresby?

1252
01:39:20,879 --> 01:39:23,799
Are you the asshole
who's commandeering my ship?

1253
01:39:24,341 --> 01:39:25,550
That would
be me.

1254
01:39:27,135 --> 01:39:30,138
The target's pretty much
this whole island group.

1255
01:39:30,931 --> 01:39:32,099
Never been up there.

1256
01:39:33,308 --> 01:39:35,769
You know those waters, doc.
What kinda indigenous we got?

1257
01:39:36,436 --> 01:39:39,898
<i>Metkayina,</i> mostly. Some
<i>Ta'unui.</i> Maybe fifty villages.

1258
01:39:40,065 --> 01:39:41,483
And you
are who?

1259
01:39:42,609 --> 01:39:43,902
I'm Ian Garvin.

1260
01:39:45,195 --> 01:39:46,613
Marine biologist.

1261
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:47,990
Fifty villages.

1262
01:39:48,115 --> 01:39:50,325
A hundred villages.
I don't care. We'll search 'em all.

1263
01:39:51,493 --> 01:39:52,786
I hunt <i>tulkun.</i>

1264
01:39:53,453 --> 01:39:55,789
That's what I'm rigged for.
That's all my guys do.

1265
01:39:55,956 --> 01:39:57,541
I've got quotas to meet.

1266
01:39:58,709 --> 01:40:00,627
I'll be nice once.

1267
01:40:01,336 --> 01:40:02,337
Then I won't.

1268
01:40:05,591 --> 01:40:07,050
Well, if you can't
get out of it...

1269
01:40:08,260 --> 01:40:09,261
get into it!

1270
01:40:10,137 --> 01:40:12,556
- All crews to stations!
- Hey, don't touch.

1271
01:40:15,017 --> 01:40:15,684
<i>Helm,
bring her up.</i>

1272
01:40:15,809 --> 01:40:16,602
Flight speed.

1273
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:18,061
Flight speed, aye.

1274
01:40:28,822 --> 01:40:30,115
What was that?

1275
01:40:31,366 --> 01:40:32,159
What's going on?

1276
01:40:35,621 --> 01:40:37,414
The <i>tulkun</i> have returned!

1277
01:40:37,581 --> 01:40:40,626
Everybody, our Brothers
and Sisters have returned.

1278
01:40:50,844 --> 01:40:53,055
<i>In their endless cycle of migration...</i>

1279
01:40:53,347 --> 01:40:55,265
<i>the</i> tulkun <i>had come home.</i>

1280
01:41:02,606 --> 01:41:04,024
Kiri, come on. Come on!

1281
01:41:04,191 --> 01:41:05,484
Tuk, leave me alone.

1282
01:41:05,609 --> 01:41:06,860
- Come on!
- What?

1283
01:41:08,445 --> 01:41:09,738
What do you want?

1284
01:41:10,072 --> 01:41:10,948
Look.

1285
01:41:19,831 --> 01:41:20,707
<i>Come on.</i>

1286
01:41:21,750 --> 01:41:22,876
Let's go meet them.

1287
01:41:23,669 --> 01:41:24,294
Look...

1288
01:41:24,419 --> 01:41:25,754
it's my Spirit Sister.

1289
01:42:48,962 --> 01:42:50,547
<i>It was a time for stories.</i>

1290
01:42:51,757 --> 01:42:53,008
<i>Of their season apart.</i>

1291
01:42:53,842 --> 01:42:54,509
<i>Of deaths...</i>

1292
01:42:54,635 --> 01:42:55,260
<i>and births.</i>

1293
01:42:57,721 --> 01:42:58,764
<i>Of old friends...</i>

1294
01:42:58,889 --> 01:42:59,806
<i>and new loves.</i>

1295
01:43:19,952 --> 01:43:20,911
Children.

1296
01:43:23,705 --> 01:43:24,581
Be calm...

1297
01:43:24,706 --> 01:43:25,749
my people.

1298
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:27,584
We're looking for weapons...

1299
01:43:27,709 --> 01:43:29,670
comms. Any kind of tech.

1300
01:43:30,170 --> 01:43:30,837
Get down.

1301
01:43:31,004 --> 01:43:31,797
You too.

1302
01:43:31,922 --> 01:43:32,756
You see this?

1303
01:43:33,715 --> 01:43:34,883
Stay down and shut up!

1304
01:43:51,733 --> 01:43:52,776
Now what's
he saying?

1305
01:43:52,943 --> 01:43:53,986
They never
saw him.

1306
01:43:54,111 --> 01:43:54,987
These are
Sea People.

1307
01:43:55,112 --> 01:43:56,655
Forest People
don't come here.

1308
01:43:56,780 --> 01:43:58,323
I ain't buyin' that.

1309
01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:11,753
They don't
know anything.

1310
01:44:14,590 --> 01:44:15,591
Shoot that animal.

1311
01:44:19,678 --> 01:44:20,637
What the hell are you doing?

1312
01:44:32,399 --> 01:44:33,609
{\an8}Your ears
workin' now?

1313
01:44:34,651 --> 01:44:36,403
You see what
these can do, huh?

1314
01:44:38,697 --> 01:44:39,865
Jake Sully.

1315
01:44:40,907 --> 01:44:43,452
<i>Toruk Makto!</i>

1316
01:44:45,162 --> 01:44:46,079
Put her down!

1317
01:44:46,246 --> 01:44:47,080
Get down!

1318
01:44:48,957 --> 01:44:49,833
Get down!

1319
01:44:50,167 --> 01:44:51,043
Stop!

1320
01:44:51,168 --> 01:44:51,835
Stop!

1321
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:53,712
You make it real
clear to him.

1322
01:44:54,296 --> 01:44:55,422
He doesn't
give up Sully...

1323
01:44:56,173 --> 01:44:57,466
<i>we kill the</i> Tsahik.

1324
01:44:57,633 --> 01:44:58,967
No, I'm not
doin' that.

1325
01:44:59,134 --> 01:45:00,093
Is that right?

1326
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:02,387
I'm not gonna be a part of this!

1327
01:45:03,096 --> 01:45:03,722
Get down!

1328
01:45:03,889 --> 01:45:05,307
These people don't
know anything!

1329
01:45:05,474 --> 01:45:06,683
They don't know anything!

1330
01:45:06,850 --> 01:45:08,018
Don't move!

1331
01:45:12,481 --> 01:45:13,440
We really
gonna waste her?

1332
01:45:14,775 --> 01:45:15,609
<i>Please.</i>

1333
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:17,152
Please don't do this.

1334
01:45:17,277 --> 01:45:18,111
This is wrong.

1335
01:45:18,278 --> 01:45:20,364
<i>What you're
doing here is wrong.</i>

1336
01:45:21,615 --> 01:45:22,449
<i>Please.</i>

1337
01:45:27,663 --> 01:45:28,872
Burn the hooches.

1338
01:45:29,873 --> 01:45:31,375
Hey, light 'em up.

1339
01:45:31,541 --> 01:45:33,001
Light 'em up. All of 'em!

1340
01:45:33,502 --> 01:45:34,628
<i>Flamethrowers up!</i>

1341
01:45:52,104 --> 01:45:53,480
I'm sorry.

1342
01:45:53,647 --> 01:45:54,815
We're outta here.

1343
01:45:56,566 --> 01:45:57,693
Don't touch me!

1344
01:45:58,402 --> 01:45:59,027
I'm sorry.

1345
01:45:59,194 --> 01:46:00,195
Let's go.

1346
01:46:00,570 --> 01:46:01,238
Saddle up.

1347
01:46:01,363 --> 01:46:02,114
All right. Let's go.

1348
01:46:27,055 --> 01:46:28,056
What's wrong?

1349
01:46:28,223 --> 01:46:29,433
Sky People.

1350
01:46:31,059 --> 01:46:32,894
They're looking
for you, Jakesully.

1351
01:46:33,437 --> 01:46:34,271
South.

1352
01:46:34,521 --> 01:46:35,272
They have a human...

1353
01:46:35,397 --> 01:46:37,316
boy who speaks <i>Na'vi.</i>

1354
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:42,821
Did they kill anybody?

1355
01:46:43,530 --> 01:46:44,906
Not yet.

1356
01:46:46,199 --> 01:46:47,284
<i>They threaten.</i>

1357
01:46:47,701 --> 01:46:50,162
But the villagers will not
tell them where you are.

1358
01:46:50,495 --> 01:46:51,580
By my order.

1359
01:46:59,546 --> 01:47:01,965
We must hunt
this demon.

1360
01:47:02,132 --> 01:47:03,175
Trap him.

1361
01:47:03,342 --> 01:47:04,259
Kill him.

1362
01:47:05,969 --> 01:47:07,054
We've gotta be smart.

1363
01:47:07,846 --> 01:47:08,847
We gotta be smart.

1364
01:47:09,014 --> 01:47:09,848
If we hit Quaritch...

1365
01:47:09,973 --> 01:47:11,934
they're gonna
know where we are...

1366
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:14,311
and they're gonna come
here with everything they've got.

1367
01:47:15,729 --> 01:47:17,064
Then what is our plan?

1368
01:47:18,774 --> 01:47:20,025
That's
<i>Toruk Makto!</i>

1369
01:47:20,275 --> 01:47:21,026
Head down.

1370
01:47:21,902 --> 01:47:23,111
Has he been here?

1371
01:47:27,908 --> 01:47:29,117
This shit ain't workin'.

1372
01:47:29,952 --> 01:47:31,244
Nah, they're
stonewallin' us.

1373
01:47:31,995 --> 01:47:33,455
If we turn up the heat...

1374
01:47:33,580 --> 01:47:35,040
he's just gonna keep runnin'.

1375
01:47:35,332 --> 01:47:36,833
We gotta
draw him out.

1376
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:47,344
I'm over it.

1377
01:47:48,553 --> 01:47:50,722
I've got quotas to meet.

1378
01:47:50,889 --> 01:47:52,474
You wanna hunt?

1379
01:47:52,849 --> 01:47:54,101
Let's hunt.

1380
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:56,395
<i>Here? Not here.</i>

1381
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:57,813
There's too many villages.

1382
01:47:57,938 --> 01:47:59,398
No.
No, no, no.

1383
01:48:00,691 --> 01:48:01,900
Respectfully, sir...

1384
01:48:02,567 --> 01:48:03,527
you do not understand...

1385
01:48:03,694 --> 01:48:04,569
the kinship bonds...

1386
01:48:04,695 --> 01:48:06,446
between the <i>tulkun</i>
and the ocean <i>Na'vi.</i>

1387
01:48:06,613 --> 01:48:08,782
It would be like murdering
a member of their family.

1388
01:48:08,949 --> 01:48:10,242
If we start
hunting here...

1389
01:48:10,367 --> 01:48:12,494
the hostiles
will come after us.

1390
01:48:12,661 --> 01:48:13,787
Exactly.

1391
01:48:14,705 --> 01:48:15,414
One hostile...

1392
01:48:15,539 --> 01:48:16,623
<i>in particular.</i>

1393
01:48:26,883 --> 01:48:28,552
I know how you feel.

1394
01:48:31,305 --> 01:48:34,266
I feel all alone too.

1395
01:48:36,226 --> 01:48:37,519
Tell me.

1396
01:48:37,686 --> 01:48:39,313
<i>Why are you outcast?</i>

1397
01:51:02,706 --> 01:51:04,041
I'm sorry.

1398
01:51:04,207 --> 01:51:05,667
I'm so sorry.

1399
01:51:09,671 --> 01:51:10,672
It's okay.

1400
01:51:11,340 --> 01:51:12,132
It's okay.

1401
01:51:26,813 --> 01:51:28,398
You allowed this.

1402
01:51:29,816 --> 01:51:33,195
You allowed him to
bond with the outcast!

1403
01:51:35,948 --> 01:51:36,949
Tsireya.

1404
01:51:38,742 --> 01:51:40,369
You disappoint
me, daughter.

1405
01:51:41,662 --> 01:51:42,913
<i>And you...</i>

1406
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:44,414
son of a
great warrior...

1407
01:51:44,539 --> 01:51:46,041
<i>who has been
taught better.</i>

1408
01:51:46,208 --> 01:51:47,793
Payakan saved
my life, sir.

1409
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:48,877
You don't
know him.

1410
01:51:49,044 --> 01:51:50,379
No, Lo'ak.

1411
01:51:51,463 --> 01:51:52,464
Sit.

1412
01:51:53,882 --> 01:51:55,133
Sit.

1413
01:51:58,011 --> 01:51:59,388
Sit down!

1414
01:52:03,475 --> 01:52:04,977
Hear my
words, boy.

1415
01:52:06,895 --> 01:52:09,273
In the days of
the First Songs...

1416
01:52:09,648 --> 01:52:12,067
<i>tulkun</i> fought
amongst themselves...

1417
01:52:12,192 --> 01:52:14,236
for territory...

1418
01:52:14,403 --> 01:52:15,737
<i>and for revenge.</i>

1419
01:52:16,738 --> 01:52:18,615
But they came
to believe...

1420
01:52:18,782 --> 01:52:21,368
that killing, no
matter how justified...

1421
01:52:21,535 --> 01:52:24,204
only brings
more killing.

1422
01:52:26,039 --> 01:52:29,334
So all killing
was forbidden.

1423
01:52:29,501 --> 01:52:32,296
This is the
<i>Tulkun</i> Way.

1424
01:52:33,547 --> 01:52:34,548
Payakan...

1425
01:52:35,424 --> 01:52:37,593
<i>is a killer, so...</i>

1426
01:52:37,593 --> 01:52:39,636
he is outcast.

1427
01:52:39,803 --> 01:52:40,804
I'm sorry, sir.

1428
01:52:40,929 --> 01:52:41,722
But you're wrong.

1429
01:52:41,888 --> 01:52:42,639
Lo'ak.

1430
01:52:43,724 --> 01:52:44,766
You speak
to <i>Olo'eyktan!</i>

1431
01:52:44,933 --> 01:52:45,726
I know
what I...

1432
01:52:45,726 --> 01:52:46,810
That's
enough!

1433
01:52:51,148 --> 01:52:52,232
I know what I know.

1434
01:52:55,736 --> 01:52:56,987
That's enough.

1435
01:52:58,780 --> 01:53:00,532
I'll deal with
this one.

1436
01:53:06,705 --> 01:53:08,165
This storm will pass.

1437
01:53:09,708 --> 01:53:13,754
Lo'ak, I saw
something today.

1438
01:53:13,921 --> 01:53:15,547
I saw a
Forest Boy...

1439
01:53:15,672 --> 01:53:16,965
chosen
by <i>tulkun.</i>

1440
01:53:17,883 --> 01:53:20,427
I am very
proud of you.

1441
01:53:20,594 --> 01:53:22,387
Payakan didn't
kill those boys.

1442
01:53:23,180 --> 01:53:24,181
I saw it all.

1443
01:53:24,348 --> 01:53:27,059
The demon ship killed his
mother right in front of him.

1444
01:53:27,225 --> 01:53:29,269
He gathered the young bulls
and the reef boys together

1445
01:53:29,394 --> 01:53:30,604
to attack the ship.

1446
01:53:31,271 --> 01:53:33,190
And they
were all killed...

1447
01:53:33,649 --> 01:53:35,567
but by the Sky
People. Not by him.

1448
01:53:35,734 --> 01:53:37,569
- He's not a killer.
- No, Lo'ak.

1449
01:53:37,736 --> 01:53:40,072
By the <i>Tulkun</i>
Way, he is.

1450
01:53:40,238 --> 01:53:41,323
He bears
those deaths.

1451
01:53:41,490 --> 01:53:43,867
Does he have to pay for
it for the rest of his life?

1452
01:53:44,034 --> 01:53:46,411
He knows what he did was wrong.
He would never do it again.

1453
01:53:48,163 --> 01:53:49,247
We must tell
my father...

1454
01:53:49,247 --> 01:53:50,248
No. No.

1455
01:53:50,248 --> 01:53:51,583
I'm in enough trouble
with my dad already.

1456
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:52,960
Your father will
understand this.

1457
01:53:53,126 --> 01:53:54,044
No, he won't.

1458
01:53:54,628 --> 01:53:56,546
He doesn't
understand anything.

1459
01:53:56,713 --> 01:53:58,340
The whole clan
hates me.

1460
01:53:58,507 --> 01:53:59,716
Demon
blood.

1461
01:53:59,883 --> 01:54:01,718
Alien.
That's all they see.

1462
01:54:07,975 --> 01:54:09,726
I See you.

1463
01:54:13,981 --> 01:54:16,566
You are
Brother of <i>Tulkun.</i>

1464
01:54:18,819 --> 01:54:20,779
You are one
of us now.

1465
01:54:37,963 --> 01:54:38,964
<i>You got my mother?</i>

1466
01:54:39,131 --> 01:54:41,925
Mother and calf. Strong
signal. Range 4,000.

1467
01:54:42,092 --> 01:54:42,884
Bring it down...

1468
01:54:43,010 --> 01:54:43,719
on the hull.

1469
01:54:43,885 --> 01:54:45,345
Comin'
down, aye.

1470
01:54:45,512 --> 01:54:46,513
Foils deployed.

1471
01:55:08,827 --> 01:55:09,620
<i>Sub teams...</i>

1472
01:55:09,745 --> 01:55:10,412
two minutes!

1473
01:55:10,412 --> 01:55:11,997
Let's get in there!

1474
01:55:12,164 --> 01:55:14,166
Hatches closed!

1475
01:55:14,333 --> 01:55:15,208
Come on,
hustle!

1476
01:55:15,334 --> 01:55:16,251
Hustle!

1477
01:55:16,418 --> 01:55:18,295
Crews to their boats.
Two minutes.

1478
01:55:18,462 --> 01:55:19,713
Let's make
some bank.

1479
01:55:20,881 --> 01:55:22,174
Boat crews!

1480
01:55:22,341 --> 01:55:24,927
Let's get those tie downs off!
Tie downs off!

1481
01:55:30,223 --> 01:55:32,059
All boats in! Boats in!

1482
01:55:36,688 --> 01:55:38,148
Let's go,
baby!

1483
01:55:49,034 --> 01:55:50,243
We're rollin'!

1484
01:56:16,603 --> 01:56:18,063
Stand by
depth charges...

1485
01:56:18,230 --> 01:56:20,232
and fire, fire, fire!

1486
01:56:42,629 --> 01:56:43,505
What's that?

1487
01:56:43,505 --> 01:56:44,506
What are
they doin'?

1488
01:56:45,799 --> 01:56:47,509
Those are
echolocation sensors.

1489
01:56:47,676 --> 01:56:49,011
How they navigate.

1490
01:56:49,177 --> 01:56:50,178
They have to hold...

1491
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:50,929
them out
of the water...

1492
01:56:51,096 --> 01:56:52,180
or they'll
go deaf.

1493
01:56:53,181 --> 01:56:54,182
Picadors!

1494
01:56:54,558 --> 01:56:55,267
Get in there!

1495
01:56:55,267 --> 01:56:55,976
Go on.

1496
01:56:55,976 --> 01:56:56,685
Get in there.

1497
01:56:56,685 --> 01:56:57,728
Get up in there!

1498
01:57:13,744 --> 01:57:15,996
They're gonna cut the cow
from the rest of the pod...

1499
01:57:16,163 --> 01:57:17,831
<i>using the
sound cannon.</i>

1500
01:57:17,998 --> 01:57:19,916
They target the mother
because the calf swims slowly...

1501
01:57:20,125 --> 01:57:23,003
and she won't
leave the calf.

1502
01:57:23,420 --> 01:57:25,047
Do they ever
fight back?

1503
01:57:25,213 --> 01:57:27,591
Nah, never seen
'em lift a fin.

1504
01:57:28,216 --> 01:57:30,135
Tough bastards
to kill though.

1505
01:57:31,428 --> 01:57:33,013
Sub teams, go!

1506
01:57:33,555 --> 01:57:34,389
And release.

1507
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:40,270
Release, release.

1508
01:57:45,067 --> 01:57:46,068
There's
our gal.

1509
01:57:46,234 --> 01:57:47,235
Target
in sight.

1510
01:57:47,736 --> 01:57:49,196
3-6 is in hot
with harpoons.

1511
01:57:49,363 --> 01:57:50,530
Here we go, baby.

1512
01:57:51,990 --> 01:57:53,951
See, we go
in from below...

1513
01:57:54,076 --> 01:57:55,911
where there's
gaps in the armor.

1514
01:57:59,790 --> 01:58:01,375
All right, let's go.
Get up in there.

1515
01:58:01,541 --> 01:58:02,542
I'm
goin' in.

1516
01:58:02,709 --> 01:58:04,002
Get me
in close.

1517
01:58:07,547 --> 01:58:08,548
<i>Hold her steady.</i>

1518
01:58:08,715 --> 01:58:10,259
<i>In range.
Arm one.</i>

1519
01:58:10,425 --> 01:58:12,094
Arming,
target lock.

1520
01:58:12,261 --> 01:58:13,387
And
one away.

1521
01:58:19,726 --> 01:58:21,144
<i>Two's in hot.</i>

1522
01:58:21,311 --> 01:58:22,312
<i>- Arm one.
- Arming.</i>

1523
01:58:22,479 --> 01:58:23,522
Fire.

1524
01:58:27,693 --> 01:58:28,652
Good strike.
Arm two.

1525
01:58:28,652 --> 01:58:29,361
Arming.

1526
01:58:29,361 --> 01:58:30,487
Two away.

1527
01:58:31,780 --> 01:58:32,781
Booyah!

1528
01:58:32,948 --> 01:58:33,865
<i>Nice.</i>

1529
01:58:34,032 --> 01:58:35,659
3-6, you owe
us a beer.

1530
01:58:40,455 --> 01:58:42,499
You see, the bags
slow her down...

1531
01:58:42,624 --> 01:58:43,875
and keep her up
at the surface.

1532
01:58:44,042 --> 01:58:45,043
Yeah.

1533
01:58:45,210 --> 01:58:46,336
Get on her!

1534
01:58:46,503 --> 01:58:47,796
<i>Get me in there.</i>

1535
01:58:47,963 --> 01:58:49,339
Straight up on her.

1536
01:58:49,590 --> 01:58:50,591
30 meters.

1537
01:58:51,466 --> 01:58:53,051
Explosive-tipped
harpoon.

1538
01:58:53,594 --> 01:58:56,263
Ten meters. Get me in there.
Put me in the pocket.

1539
01:58:56,763 --> 01:58:57,931
Now steady, steady.

1540
01:58:57,931 --> 01:58:59,057
Stay
with her.

1541
01:58:59,391 --> 01:59:00,976
Hold. Hold.

1542
01:59:03,145 --> 01:59:04,354
Line's runnin'!

1543
01:59:11,194 --> 01:59:13,322
Hold on to your
ponytail, Colonel!

1544
01:59:24,249 --> 01:59:25,334
Hold back full!

1545
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:26,835
Back full, aye.

1546
01:59:33,508 --> 01:59:34,676
Hold her.

1547
01:59:34,843 --> 01:59:35,969
Hold her.

1548
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:41,934
She takes an explosive
harpoon to the chest...

1549
01:59:42,059 --> 01:59:43,477
and she's
still runnin'.

1550
01:59:44,394 --> 01:59:46,021
Beautiful.

1551
02:00:59,886 --> 02:01:02,681
The only way to reach
the gland is from below.

1552
02:01:02,848 --> 02:01:05,058
We drill up through
the hard palate...

1553
02:01:05,976 --> 02:01:07,978
into the brain. And...

1554
02:01:11,773 --> 02:01:14,026
These are highly
intelligent beings.

1555
02:01:14,192 --> 02:01:15,152
Probably smarter
than us.

1556
02:01:15,319 --> 02:01:16,570
Not smarter than me.

1557
02:01:16,737 --> 02:01:18,196
That is setting
the bar very low.

1558
02:01:18,363 --> 02:01:19,906
Hey, I'm the one
with the harpoon.

1559
02:01:21,491 --> 02:01:22,492
Yep.

1560
02:01:33,587 --> 02:01:34,588
How do
you know?

1561
02:01:34,755 --> 02:01:36,006
That they're
smarter than us?

1562
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:38,508
More neurons, more pathways.

1563
02:01:39,384 --> 02:01:41,553
Not only are they
smarter, they're...

1564
02:01:41,678 --> 02:01:42,930
deeply
emotional.

1565
02:01:43,847 --> 02:01:45,098
More spiritual.

1566
02:01:49,436 --> 02:01:52,356
See, this region here corresponds
with our emotional centers...

1567
02:01:52,522 --> 02:01:54,983
but proportionally
it's much larger.

1568
02:01:56,360 --> 02:01:57,903
They have music...

1569
02:01:58,070 --> 02:01:59,613
philosophy...

1570
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:01,365
mathematics...

1571
02:02:01,865 --> 02:02:03,200
complex language.

1572
02:02:03,784 --> 02:02:04,409
Okay.

1573
02:02:05,202 --> 02:02:06,328
Here we go.

1574
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:08,497
Show me
the money.

1575
02:02:13,210 --> 02:02:15,212
So that's what this is all about?

1576
02:02:15,837 --> 02:02:17,172
That's it.

1577
02:02:17,339 --> 02:02:18,340
Amrita.

1578
02:02:21,260 --> 02:02:23,178
Bad luck for the big guys.

1579
02:02:23,345 --> 02:02:26,598
This stuff just happens to
stop human aging. Like...

1580
02:02:27,182 --> 02:02:28,558
stops it.

1581
02:02:31,061 --> 02:02:33,272
<i>Ounce for ounce the
single most valuable...</i>

1582
02:02:33,397 --> 02:02:35,357
substance known to man.

1583
02:02:37,067 --> 02:02:39,069
This little vial
here is worth like...

1584
02:02:40,237 --> 02:02:41,488
80 million.

1585
02:02:42,531 --> 02:02:43,407
Think fast!

1586
02:02:44,741 --> 02:02:45,909
Please don't.

1587
02:02:47,160 --> 02:02:48,036
<i>It's never funny.</i>

1588
02:02:49,079 --> 02:02:52,249
Amrita is what's paying for
everything here on Pandora now.

1589
02:02:53,208 --> 02:02:55,627
Even your research.
Ain't that right, Dr. G?

1590
02:02:55,794 --> 02:02:57,087
It's why I drink.

1591
02:02:59,506 --> 02:03:00,591
That's all you take?

1592
02:03:01,883 --> 02:03:03,927
I mean, you just
waste the rest?

1593
02:03:05,470 --> 02:03:07,055
Drop the bags.

1594
02:03:07,639 --> 02:03:08,807
Let's sink her!

1595
02:03:08,974 --> 02:03:11,059
No. Leave
the bags.

1596
02:03:11,435 --> 02:03:13,228
I want 'em to know it was us.

1597
02:03:13,895 --> 02:03:17,274
I charge extra for
bein' used as bait.

1598
02:03:51,558 --> 02:03:54,061
Her name is Ro'a.

1599
02:03:56,438 --> 02:03:59,274
She was my Spirit Sister.

1600
02:04:01,652 --> 02:04:04,404
She was a
composer of songs.

1601
02:04:04,571 --> 02:04:05,864
Much revered.

1602
02:04:06,031 --> 02:04:07,282
We would
sing together.

1603
02:04:08,951 --> 02:04:12,621
She waited many breeding
cycles to have this calf.

1604
02:04:13,121 --> 02:04:15,374
<i>The clan were
so happy for her.</i>

1605
02:04:18,502 --> 02:04:20,420
What is this, Tonowari?

1606
02:04:23,173 --> 02:04:24,841
What is this?

1607
02:04:44,403 --> 02:04:47,322
My Spirit Sister
and her baby...

1608
02:04:47,489 --> 02:04:50,033
have been murdered
by the Sky People!

1609
02:04:51,368 --> 02:04:53,578
<i>This war has come to us.</i>

1610
02:04:54,413 --> 02:04:55,956
<i>We knew
about this hunting...</i>

1611
02:04:56,081 --> 02:04:57,833
<i>of our</i>
tulkun <i>people.</i>

1612
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:59,376
But it was
over the horizon...

1613
02:04:59,793 --> 02:05:00,919
far away.

1614
02:05:01,086 --> 02:05:02,879
Now it
is here!

1615
02:05:06,633 --> 02:05:07,634
<i>No, you don't...</i>

1616
02:05:07,801 --> 02:05:09,928
<i>You gotta understand
how the Sky People think.</i>

1617
02:05:10,095 --> 02:05:11,805
They don't care
about the Great Balance.

1618
02:05:11,972 --> 02:05:13,515
We don't answer
to Sky People!

1619
02:05:13,682 --> 02:05:15,517
Listen. Listen to him.

1620
02:05:15,684 --> 02:05:16,810
The Sky People
are not gonna stop.

1621
02:05:16,977 --> 02:05:17,894
This is only
the beginning.

1622
02:05:18,061 --> 02:05:20,105
You gotta tell
your <i>tulkun</i> to leave.

1623
02:05:21,273 --> 02:05:23,275
You gotta tell them
to go far away!

1624
02:05:23,609 --> 02:05:24,359
Leave?

1625
02:05:26,028 --> 02:05:27,237
You live
among us...

1626
02:05:28,363 --> 02:05:30,157
and you
learn nothing!

1627
02:05:30,282 --> 02:05:33,452
We will fight to protect
our brothers and sisters!

1628
02:05:33,619 --> 02:05:34,786
No, no, no.

1629
02:05:36,413 --> 02:05:37,497
If you attack...

1630
02:05:37,664 --> 02:05:39,374
if you fight...

1631
02:05:39,541 --> 02:05:40,876
then they will
destroy you!

1632
02:05:41,043 --> 02:05:41,835
They will destroy...

1633
02:05:41,960 --> 02:05:43,003
everything
that you love.

1634
02:05:43,962 --> 02:05:44,630
No!

1635
02:05:44,755 --> 02:05:45,923
<i>You hear
my words!</i>

1636
02:05:46,548 --> 02:05:47,549
Hear my words!

1637
02:05:47,716 --> 02:05:48,717
Stay calm.

1638
02:05:48,884 --> 02:05:49,718
<i>Stay calm!</i>

1639
02:05:50,427 --> 02:05:51,428
<i>Listen to my father.</i>

1640
02:05:51,595 --> 02:05:52,429
Damn it!

1641
02:05:52,596 --> 02:05:53,847
He speaks the truth.

1642
02:06:03,857 --> 02:06:05,192
You tell the <i>tulkun...</i>

1643
02:06:06,985 --> 02:06:08,445
that if they're hit
by one of these...

1644
02:06:08,570 --> 02:06:09,738
they're marked for death.

1645
02:06:12,824 --> 02:06:13,700
<i>And call for me...</i>

1646
02:06:13,825 --> 02:06:15,035
I'll silence it.

1647
02:06:17,704 --> 02:06:19,623
Saving their lives,
that's all that matters.

1648
02:06:20,666 --> 02:06:22,000
<i>Right?</i>

1649
02:06:24,503 --> 02:06:26,213
Saving your family.

1650
02:06:39,059 --> 02:06:40,269
Tell the <i>tulkun</i>.

1651
02:06:41,561 --> 02:06:42,562
Go.

1652
02:06:42,980 --> 02:06:44,064
<i>Go!</i>

1653
02:06:47,693 --> 02:06:49,361
We must fight.

1654
02:06:50,487 --> 02:06:52,072
<i>MaJake.</i>

1655
02:06:52,239 --> 02:06:53,824
I will not stand and
do nothing!

1656
02:06:54,658 --> 02:06:56,868
It's a trap. They
want us to hit back.

1657
02:06:57,619 --> 02:06:59,204
They're not hunting <i>tulkun</i>.

1658
02:06:59,371 --> 02:07:00,872
They're hunting us.

1659
02:07:15,429 --> 02:07:17,347
No way you're rolling
out of here, baby brother.

1660
02:07:17,514 --> 02:07:19,099
I have to warn Payakan
about the pingers.

1661
02:07:19,766 --> 02:07:20,475
No.

1662
02:07:20,642 --> 02:07:22,561
You've gotta keep
your <i>skxawng</i> ass here.

1663
02:07:22,728 --> 02:07:23,770
He's outcast.

1664
02:07:23,937 --> 02:07:25,689
There's nobody
to warn him but me.

1665
02:07:25,856 --> 02:07:26,648
Bro...

1666
02:07:27,899 --> 02:07:29,943
why do you always have
to make things so hard?

1667
02:07:31,528 --> 02:07:32,571
No.

1668
02:07:32,738 --> 02:07:35,324
You mean why can't I be
the perfect son like you?

1669
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:38,160
The perfect
little soldier.

1670
02:07:38,952 --> 02:07:40,203
Well,
I'm not you!

1671
02:07:40,871 --> 02:07:41,705
Okay?

1672
02:07:42,372 --> 02:07:43,123
I'm not you.

1673
02:07:44,541 --> 02:07:45,876
He's my brother.

1674
02:07:46,043 --> 02:07:47,085
I'm going.

1675
02:07:47,252 --> 02:07:48,629
He's your
brother?

1676
02:07:49,796 --> 02:07:51,715
No, I'm
your brother.

1677
02:07:51,882 --> 02:07:52,716
Lo'ak!

1678
02:07:53,300 --> 02:07:54,384
Get off me.

1679
02:07:55,594 --> 02:07:56,428
Lo'ak!

1680
02:07:56,595 --> 02:07:57,262
Come back!

1681
02:07:57,387 --> 02:07:58,013
Come on.

1682
02:07:58,138 --> 02:07:59,181
He's going to Payakan.

1683
02:08:11,276 --> 02:08:12,402
Come back!

1684
02:08:13,570 --> 02:08:15,030
There's
Lo'ak! Lo'ak.

1685
02:08:15,405 --> 02:08:16,448
Lo'ak!

1686
02:08:16,615 --> 02:08:18,158
Lo'ak's going
to find Payakan!

1687
02:08:18,617 --> 02:08:19,451
Wait up!

1688
02:08:21,119 --> 02:08:21,870
Hold on!

1689
02:08:31,213 --> 02:08:32,965
- All crews to stations.
- Sound general call.

1690
02:08:33,131 --> 02:08:35,300
All right, people. Come on.
Let's make some money!

1691
02:08:44,184 --> 02:08:45,185
Brother!

1692
02:08:45,602 --> 02:08:46,228
Lo'ak!

1693
02:08:48,730 --> 02:08:49,356
Lo'ak!

1694
02:08:49,356 --> 02:08:50,065
Wait!

1695
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:54,653
What is it?
What's wrong?

1696
02:08:56,655 --> 02:08:57,823
Shit!

1697
02:08:58,490 --> 02:09:00,409
Stay calm.
Stay calm.

1698
02:09:01,159 --> 02:09:02,411
I got this.

1699
02:09:08,875 --> 02:09:09,835
Shit!

1700
02:09:14,047 --> 02:09:15,215
Bro, come on!
Help me out!

1701
02:09:15,882 --> 02:09:16,842
Hurry, the
ship's coming!

1702
02:09:16,967 --> 02:09:17,801
They're over there!

1703
02:09:20,220 --> 02:09:21,471
Bro, come on!

1704
02:09:22,431 --> 02:09:23,724
Bro.

1705
02:09:23,890 --> 02:09:24,600
Come on, bro.

1706
02:09:24,725 --> 02:09:25,350
Hurry!

1707
02:09:25,726 --> 02:09:26,768
Call it in!

1708
02:09:26,893 --> 02:09:27,811
Call Dad!

1709
02:09:28,353 --> 02:09:29,521
Call Dad!
Just go! Do it!

1710
02:09:29,688 --> 02:09:30,772
Just do it.

1711
02:09:31,607 --> 02:09:33,567
Dad. I mean, Devil Dog.
Do you read me?

1712
02:09:33,734 --> 02:09:34,901
Did you see
where they went?

1713
02:09:35,027 --> 02:09:35,944
<i>It's Eagle Eye,
do you copy?</i>

1714
02:09:36,069 --> 02:09:37,487
- They went outside the reef.
- Yeah, Lo'ak.

1715
02:09:37,654 --> 02:09:38,280
<i>Dad!</i>

1716
02:09:39,740 --> 02:09:42,034
We're with a <i>tulkun</i>
that's under attack.

1717
02:09:42,200 --> 02:09:43,285
Killer ship's inbound.

1718
02:09:43,452 --> 02:09:44,828
<i>It's about
two klicks out.</i>

1719
02:09:45,454 --> 02:09:46,121
Who's with you?

1720
02:09:46,121 --> 02:09:46,830
<i>It's all of us.</i>

1721
02:09:47,039 --> 02:09:48,373
<i>Aonung and Tsireya too.</i>

1722
02:09:48,540 --> 02:09:49,916
We're at
Three Brothers Rocks.

1723
02:09:50,083 --> 02:09:51,960
You get to cover,
and you do not engage.

1724
02:09:52,127 --> 02:09:53,003
All right? You hear me?

1725
02:09:53,170 --> 02:09:54,212
Do not engage.
We're comin'.

1726
02:09:54,379 --> 02:09:55,213
Yes, sir.

1727
02:09:55,380 --> 02:09:56,506
It's getting closer!

1728
02:09:56,632 --> 02:09:58,759
- Three, two, pull!
- Pull!

1729
02:09:59,718 --> 02:10:01,094
<i>Kids are under attack!</i>

1730
02:10:01,637 --> 02:10:03,555
The kids are under attack.
They were defending a <i>tulkun.</i>

1731
02:10:03,722 --> 02:10:04,973
<i>It's your kids too.</i>

1732
02:10:05,140 --> 02:10:06,183
The demon ship?

1733
02:10:06,350 --> 02:10:06,975
Yes!

1734
02:10:06,975 --> 02:10:07,684
We gotta go!

1735
02:10:07,809 --> 02:10:09,519
Weapons.
Sound the alarm!

1736
02:10:13,732 --> 02:10:14,816
You should stay back.

1737
02:10:15,150 --> 02:10:16,026
I ride!

1738
02:10:16,360 --> 02:10:16,985
<i>Come!</i>

1739
02:11:06,451 --> 02:11:08,287
Sub teams, hatches close.

1740
02:11:08,453 --> 02:11:09,913
Two-minute warning.

1741
02:11:16,878 --> 02:11:17,879
Aonung!

1742
02:11:18,839 --> 02:11:19,881
Hurry up! Come on!

1743
02:11:20,048 --> 02:11:21,216
Bro, hurry up!

1744
02:11:23,677 --> 02:11:24,428
Go, go, go!

1745
02:11:28,599 --> 02:11:29,766
Pull! Now!

1746
02:11:31,727 --> 02:11:33,437
- Everybody! Together!
- Pull!

1747
02:11:37,274 --> 02:11:38,650
I'll be damned.

1748
02:11:39,901 --> 02:11:41,111
Sully's kids.

1749
02:11:41,570 --> 02:11:43,238
Let's roll.
Not you.

1750
02:11:43,822 --> 02:11:44,823
Saddle up.

1751
02:11:56,585 --> 02:11:58,211
Range is 700 meters.

1752
02:11:58,378 --> 02:11:59,963
Pinger signal is good.

1753
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:03,216
Pull, harder!

1754
02:12:03,383 --> 02:12:04,593
Pull!

1755
02:12:05,344 --> 02:12:06,678
Pull, harder!

1756
02:12:06,845 --> 02:12:07,804
Go!

1757
02:12:08,263 --> 02:12:09,890
It's out!
Kiri, it's out!

1758
02:12:10,015 --> 02:12:11,016
Go.
Tuk, go.

1759
02:12:11,475 --> 02:12:13,143
Come on. Get out of here!

1760
02:12:13,310 --> 02:12:14,311
Go that way!

1761
02:12:14,436 --> 02:12:15,062
I'll draw
them off.

1762
02:12:15,187 --> 02:12:16,521
- Okay.
- Lo'ak, come.

1763
02:12:18,190 --> 02:12:19,566
Go, go, dive!

1764
02:12:19,733 --> 02:12:21,151
Now, dive!

1765
02:12:21,276 --> 02:12:21,944
Grab on.

1766
02:12:31,954 --> 02:12:33,038
Range 300.

1767
02:12:33,205 --> 02:12:34,915
Ready depth charges...

1768
02:12:35,082 --> 02:12:37,417
and fire, fire, fire.

1769
02:12:43,340 --> 02:12:44,716
No depth charges.

1770
02:12:44,841 --> 02:12:46,093
Scoresby,
you copy?

1771
02:12:46,218 --> 02:12:47,844
These kids are
worthless to me dead.

1772
02:12:48,428 --> 02:12:49,846
Hold your fire.

1773
02:12:54,434 --> 02:12:57,187
Circle out. Get a cordon around 'em.

1774
02:12:57,354 --> 02:12:58,689
Get your subs in the water.

1775
02:12:59,606 --> 02:13:01,525
Sub teams, get wet.

1776
02:13:51,074 --> 02:13:53,076
Crabs flank right.
Get around on 'em.

1777
02:13:56,872 --> 02:13:58,165
Don't lose 'em.
Stay on 'em now.

1778
02:13:58,665 --> 02:13:59,750
Planes up. We're goin' in!

1779
02:13:59,916 --> 02:14:01,209
Oh, hell yeah!

1780
02:14:33,033 --> 02:14:34,785
Tone on lock.
Two away.

1781
02:15:04,398 --> 02:15:05,357
Where is Tuk?

1782
02:15:05,482 --> 02:15:06,316
Did you see her?

1783
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:24,001
Tuk!

1784
02:15:26,628 --> 02:15:27,546
Target in sight.

1785
02:15:32,134 --> 02:15:33,343
It is coming.

1786
02:15:33,510 --> 02:15:34,803
We gotta go!

1787
02:15:51,194 --> 02:15:52,237
- Switch net.
- Switching.

1788
02:15:52,362 --> 02:15:53,113
Fire.

1789
02:16:13,592 --> 02:16:14,343
Hold on!

1790
02:16:14,718 --> 02:16:15,594
Let me out!

1791
02:16:16,219 --> 02:16:17,220
- Watch out!
- Tuk, move!

1792
02:16:17,387 --> 02:16:18,305
Move your hand! Move your hand!

1793
02:16:18,472 --> 02:16:20,223
<i>- Cut it!</i>
- Hurry, hurry!

1794
02:16:24,686 --> 02:16:26,271
Hey, kid, get back here!

1795
02:16:32,027 --> 02:16:32,652
Drop the weapon.

1796
02:16:32,777 --> 02:16:33,653
- Put the weapon down!
- Put it down.

1797
02:16:34,112 --> 02:16:34,946
<i>Put it down!</i>

1798
02:16:37,157 --> 02:16:37,866
Stay down.

1799
02:16:38,784 --> 02:16:40,660
- Hey, kid, get back here!
- Get him! Get him!

1800
02:16:40,910 --> 02:16:42,161
Put the weapon down!

1801
02:16:42,579 --> 02:16:43,497
Drop it, now!

1802
02:16:43,705 --> 02:16:45,081
- Put it down!
- Drop the knife.

1803
02:16:45,248 --> 02:16:46,249
Drop it.

1804
02:16:46,833 --> 02:16:48,751
Hey! Hey, what are
you doing? Stop!

1805
02:16:48,919 --> 02:16:50,044
Stop.
Don't hurt them.

1806
02:16:51,630 --> 02:16:52,297
Stop moving.

1807
02:16:52,506 --> 02:16:54,508
-<i>Spider!</i>
- Bro, you okay?

1808
02:16:55,008 --> 02:16:56,259
Yeah. Great, cuz.

1809
02:16:56,426 --> 02:16:57,469
Never better.

1810
02:17:00,304 --> 02:17:01,306
Knock it off.
Stay still.

1811
02:17:04,268 --> 02:17:05,268
Get back
to the bridge.

1812
02:17:06,894 --> 02:17:07,896
Keep him there!

1813
02:17:08,062 --> 02:17:09,481
I'm going,
I'm going.

1814
02:17:10,649 --> 02:17:11,775
<i>Yeah.</i>

1815
02:17:11,942 --> 02:17:13,068
I remember you.

1816
02:17:14,236 --> 02:17:15,862
Cuff 'em to the
rail. All of 'em.

1817
02:17:15,988 --> 02:17:16,696
Let's go.

1818
02:17:17,656 --> 02:17:18,907
Let's go. Move!

1819
02:17:18,907 --> 02:17:19,700
Over here.

1820
02:17:19,700 --> 02:17:20,784
Watch 'em.
They bite.

1821
02:17:21,952 --> 02:17:22,619
Get on your knees.

1822
02:17:22,619 --> 02:17:23,328
On 'em.

1823
02:17:23,328 --> 02:17:24,036
Give me your hand.

1824
02:17:24,036 --> 02:17:24,787
No!

1825
02:17:26,080 --> 02:17:26,706
Now the other.

1826
02:17:26,831 --> 02:17:27,833
No.

1827
02:17:31,794 --> 02:17:32,795
Be brave.

1828
02:17:37,467 --> 02:17:38,552
<i>Na'vi</i> inbound!

1829
02:17:41,013 --> 02:17:42,014
Spread out.
Weapons up.

1830
02:17:42,014 --> 02:17:42,723
Dad!

1831
02:17:42,848 --> 02:17:44,433
Push left.
Spread out.

1832
02:17:46,852 --> 02:17:47,853
Stop.
Stop them.

1833
02:17:51,982 --> 02:17:53,317
It's Sully.

1834
02:17:55,569 --> 02:17:56,570
300 yards.

1835
02:18:02,576 --> 02:18:03,910
They got our kids.

1836
02:18:04,077 --> 02:18:05,370
Your daughter.

1837
02:18:05,536 --> 02:18:06,537
Tuk. Lo'ak.

1838
02:18:09,541 --> 02:18:10,167
Jake...

1839
02:18:10,750 --> 02:18:12,878
tell your friends
to stand down.

1840
02:18:14,004 --> 02:18:15,964
You want your kids back...

1841
02:18:16,131 --> 02:18:17,674
you come out alone.

1842
02:18:20,469 --> 02:18:22,596
You know better
than to test my resolve.

1843
02:18:23,931 --> 02:18:25,057
Lo'ak!
No!

1844
02:18:28,143 --> 02:18:30,103
<i>I took you under my wing, Jake.</i>

1845
02:18:30,646 --> 02:18:32,563
You betrayed me.

1846
02:18:32,731 --> 02:18:34,107
You killed your own.

1847
02:18:34,274 --> 02:18:36,108
Good men.
Good women.

1848
02:18:36,276 --> 02:18:39,363
I will not hesitate
to execute your kid.

1849
02:18:40,864 --> 02:18:41,865
Just wait one.

1850
02:18:53,210 --> 02:18:54,336
Hold here.

1851
02:18:55,337 --> 02:18:57,214
They are
killers of <i>tulkun.</i>

1852
02:18:57,839 --> 02:18:59,049
They must die.

1853
02:18:59,215 --> 02:19:01,009
Here. Today.

1854
02:19:01,176 --> 02:19:02,803
It's me that they want.

1855
02:19:02,970 --> 02:19:04,471
That's what all this
has been about, all right?

1856
02:19:04,638 --> 02:19:07,057
The hunting of our <i>tulkun.</i>
The taking of our kids.

1857
02:19:10,185 --> 02:19:12,104
You brought
this upon us!

1858
02:19:12,562 --> 02:19:13,647
You!

1859
02:19:17,483 --> 02:19:19,236
Well, then it's me
that has to do this.

1860
02:19:25,491 --> 02:19:27,327
Offer's fixin' to expire.

1861
02:19:27,494 --> 02:19:29,036
What's it gonna be?

1862
02:19:29,787 --> 02:19:31,248
Check your fire.

1863
02:19:31,415 --> 02:19:32,581
I'm comin' out.

1864
02:19:43,677 --> 02:19:44,385
<i>MaJake...</i>

1865
02:19:44,510 --> 02:19:45,303
what is happening?

1866
02:19:46,221 --> 02:19:47,306
<i>MaJake?</i>

1867
02:19:49,975 --> 02:19:52,686
Stay tense everybody.
All weapons.

1868
02:20:10,037 --> 02:20:11,622
Easy shot.

1869
02:20:12,205 --> 02:20:14,291
You hit him
now, they attack.

1870
02:20:15,584 --> 02:20:17,544
Wait till
he's on board.

1871
02:20:44,363 --> 02:20:45,739
Payakan!

1872
02:20:57,417 --> 02:20:58,377
Open fire.
Open fire!

1873
02:21:00,963 --> 02:21:01,713
Brother!

1874
02:21:06,718 --> 02:21:08,345
- Come about!
- Comin' about!

1875
02:21:08,470 --> 02:21:09,805
Get me around!

1876
02:21:10,597 --> 02:21:11,431
Get me a shot!

1877
02:21:12,557 --> 02:21:14,393
Go, go!

1878
02:21:33,078 --> 02:21:34,204
Get me around!

1879
02:21:34,371 --> 02:21:35,789
Go, go, go!

1880
02:21:37,582 --> 02:21:38,208
Get in there...

1881
02:21:38,375 --> 02:21:40,210
get me in range.
Go, go, go.

1882
02:21:49,344 --> 02:21:50,053
Down!

1883
02:21:53,432 --> 02:21:54,933
Bloody hell!

1884
02:21:59,104 --> 02:21:59,896
Open fire!

1885
02:22:00,731 --> 02:22:01,523
Open fire!

1886
02:22:05,819 --> 02:22:07,029
Sully's inbound.

1887
02:22:07,195 --> 02:22:08,405
I want eyes on!

1888
02:22:08,697 --> 02:22:10,616
All right, let's go.
Saddle up. We're up!

1889
02:22:52,574 --> 02:22:54,660
Somebody
shoot something!

1890
02:23:10,384 --> 02:23:11,009
Stop!

1891
02:24:06,815 --> 02:24:08,066
Get after them. Go!

1892
02:24:25,292 --> 02:24:27,210
Breach!
Masks on!

1893
02:24:27,544 --> 02:24:28,962
Masks
on! Go!

1894
02:25:08,710 --> 02:25:10,045
Get him
out of here!

1895
02:25:15,092 --> 02:25:16,093
Calm down!

1896
02:25:30,315 --> 02:25:31,441
Go, go, go!

1897
02:25:44,997 --> 02:25:46,248
Damage report!

1898
02:25:46,415 --> 02:25:47,165
Flooding.

1899
02:25:47,291 --> 02:25:48,208
Compartment
two and three.

1900
02:25:48,792 --> 02:25:49,543
You okay?

1901
02:26:19,281 --> 02:26:20,282
Port bow!

1902
02:26:21,408 --> 02:26:22,492
Hard port!

1903
02:26:22,618 --> 02:26:23,285
Open fire!

1904
02:26:24,328 --> 02:26:25,537
Get me a shot!

1905
02:26:26,580 --> 02:26:27,247
Got ya!

1906
02:26:45,098 --> 02:26:46,683
Cut us away!

1907
02:26:46,850 --> 02:26:47,935
Not responding!

1908
02:26:48,310 --> 02:26:50,103
Get us off the cable!

1909
02:26:50,270 --> 02:26:52,189
Who's got the
harpoon now?

1910
02:26:56,652 --> 02:26:57,861
Back full!

1911
02:27:09,456 --> 02:27:10,582
Reload!

1912
02:27:13,835 --> 02:27:15,671
Not the cable,
you idiot!

1913
02:27:16,922 --> 02:27:18,131
We're dead
in the water.

1914
02:27:19,466 --> 02:27:21,051
Taking on water. Pumps on.

1915
02:27:21,802 --> 02:27:23,095
Man your
weapons!

1916
02:27:23,262 --> 02:27:25,639
I thought you were the
intelligent species here, Scoresby.

1917
02:27:25,889 --> 02:27:27,349
Shut ya cakehole, Garvin.

1918
02:27:29,518 --> 02:27:30,727
Where are you?

1919
02:27:31,395 --> 02:27:32,729
Cheeky bugger.

1920
02:27:32,896 --> 02:27:34,815
You think you're
pretty clever, don't ya?

1921
02:27:50,080 --> 02:27:51,164
Get down!

1922
02:28:03,302 --> 02:28:04,303
Pumps aren't working.

1923
02:28:04,469 --> 02:28:05,262
Abandon ship!

1924
02:28:05,387 --> 02:28:06,263
Abandon ship!

1925
02:28:06,430 --> 02:28:07,723
- Get him to a boat!
<i>- All crew to the boats.</i>

1926
02:28:07,889 --> 02:28:09,766
Let's go, people!
Let's move! Mask up!

1927
02:28:15,230 --> 02:28:16,523
Neteyam!

1928
02:28:17,065 --> 02:28:18,150
Hey,
baby brother.

1929
02:28:18,317 --> 02:28:19,401
Need some help?

1930
02:28:19,901 --> 02:28:20,944
Shut up. Come on.

1931
02:28:21,069 --> 02:28:21,862
Get us loose.

1932
02:28:24,948 --> 02:28:27,117
- Okay, get Tuk out of here.
- Bro, hurry up!

1933
02:28:28,910 --> 02:28:30,495
Who's the Mighty Warrior?
Come on.

1934
02:28:30,621 --> 02:28:31,413
Say it.

1935
02:28:32,039 --> 02:28:33,415
- Bro!
- Come on. Let's go.

1936
02:28:35,208 --> 02:28:36,251
Lo'ak!

1937
02:28:37,127 --> 02:28:38,128
They've
got Spider.

1938
02:28:38,295 --> 02:28:40,005
We've gotta get him.
Come on.

1939
02:28:40,380 --> 02:28:41,381
Come on, bro.

1940
02:28:41,590 --> 02:28:42,799
We can't
leave him.

1941
02:28:50,933 --> 02:28:51,975
Let me go!

1942
02:28:54,186 --> 02:28:55,395
No!

1943
02:28:57,564 --> 02:28:58,398
Look!

1944
02:29:05,238 --> 02:29:06,907
Let's go, buttercup.
Get up.

1945
02:29:07,074 --> 02:29:09,242
I'm not your
buttercup, perv!

1946
02:29:09,409 --> 02:29:10,661
We've got to go
back for her.

1947
02:29:11,787 --> 02:29:12,788
Tuk, wait!

1948
02:29:12,955 --> 02:29:14,498
Sullys
stick together.

1949
02:29:26,218 --> 02:29:27,761
Wait right there, guys. Wait.

1950
02:29:28,762 --> 02:29:29,846
Clear to drop!

1951
02:29:31,223 --> 02:29:32,474
Check your mask.
Make sure it's tight.

1952
02:29:32,641 --> 02:29:33,767
I'm good, dumbass.

1953
02:29:36,937 --> 02:29:37,938
Move, move!

1954
02:29:38,105 --> 02:29:39,273
Evacuating, people.

1955
02:29:43,527 --> 02:29:44,278
Tuk...

1956
02:29:44,528 --> 02:29:46,071
this is not a good idea.

1957
02:29:46,238 --> 02:29:47,197
Tuk!

1958
02:30:07,467 --> 02:30:08,343
Cut it here.

1959
02:30:11,597 --> 02:30:12,222
No!

1960
02:30:18,604 --> 02:30:19,605
I got her.

1961
02:30:26,236 --> 02:30:27,404
We can still
get this done.

1962
02:30:27,571 --> 02:30:28,530
Hell yeah.

1963
02:30:29,406 --> 02:30:31,867
I can't believe
I'm tied up again!

1964
02:30:58,060 --> 02:30:59,019
Bro, come on.

1965
02:30:59,144 --> 02:30:59,770
Let's go.

1966
02:31:03,482 --> 02:31:04,316
Thanks, guys.

1967
02:31:06,944 --> 02:31:07,569
Go!

1968
02:31:07,694 --> 02:31:08,362
No!

1969
02:31:08,528 --> 02:31:09,571
- Bro, come on!
- Go, go, go!

1970
02:31:10,822 --> 02:31:12,199
Go, go, go!

1971
02:31:14,910 --> 02:31:15,911
Give me that!

1972
02:31:19,998 --> 02:31:21,083
Go, go, go!

1973
02:31:21,792 --> 02:31:22,793
This way.

1974
02:31:30,342 --> 02:31:31,343
Cover, cover!

1975
02:31:37,432 --> 02:31:38,433
You see 'em?

1976
02:31:49,361 --> 02:31:50,362
<i>Bro!</i>

1977
02:31:50,529 --> 02:31:51,655
That was insane, cuz.

1978
02:31:51,655 --> 02:31:52,364
<i>Yeah.</i>

1979
02:31:57,244 --> 02:31:58,245
Get on!

1980
02:31:58,412 --> 02:31:59,413
Come on, bro!

1981
02:31:59,746 --> 02:32:00,831
You <i>skxawng.</i>

1982
02:32:01,540 --> 02:32:02,541
I'm shot.

1983
02:32:06,336 --> 02:32:07,337
Shit!

1984
02:32:08,213 --> 02:32:09,214
Gimme a hand!

1985
02:32:12,259 --> 02:32:13,635
- Keep him up!
- I got him.

1986
02:32:13,760 --> 02:32:14,386
Come on.

1987
02:32:18,223 --> 02:32:19,474
- Grab him.
- Bro, I got him.

1988
02:32:21,143 --> 02:32:22,144
Holy shit.

1989
02:32:22,311 --> 02:32:23,312
Hold him up!

1990
02:32:25,939 --> 02:32:26,940
Bro, come on.

1991
02:32:27,649 --> 02:32:28,984
It's okay, bro. I got you.

1992
02:32:29,151 --> 02:32:30,235
Hurry. Go, go, go!

1993
02:32:31,278 --> 02:32:32,613
They have Kiri and Tuk.

1994
02:32:33,989 --> 02:32:34,990
I can't go back.

1995
02:32:42,539 --> 02:32:43,540
Dad!

1996
02:32:44,416 --> 02:32:45,751
Dad, help!
It's Neteyam!

1997
02:32:45,917 --> 02:32:46,960
Hurry!

1998
02:32:47,127 --> 02:32:48,462
Here! Take him.

1999
02:32:50,547 --> 02:32:52,257
- Oh, no.
- It's Neteyam! He's hurt!

2000
02:32:52,424 --> 02:32:53,634
- Jake.
- Come on. Come on!

2001
02:32:53,800 --> 02:32:54,843
Hurry, please!

2002
02:32:55,677 --> 02:32:56,345
Pull!

2003
02:32:59,097 --> 02:33:00,265
Bro, watch his head.

2004
02:33:00,432 --> 02:33:01,683
Pull!

2005
02:33:02,142 --> 02:33:03,101
Come on!

2006
02:33:06,480 --> 02:33:07,814
Just watch his head.

2007
02:33:08,398 --> 02:33:09,024
Okay.

2008
02:33:10,067 --> 02:33:10,817
It's okay, bro.

2009
02:33:10,943 --> 02:33:11,610
We got you.

2010
02:33:12,361 --> 02:33:13,111
Oh, no.

2011
02:33:15,322 --> 02:33:16,281
Put pressure.

2012
02:33:16,406 --> 02:33:17,199
Put pressure
on it.

2013
02:33:19,326 --> 02:33:20,452
Dad, I...

2014
02:33:20,577 --> 02:33:21,453
It's okay.
I'm here.

2015
02:33:23,956 --> 02:33:25,207
No, no, no.

2016
02:33:25,374 --> 02:33:26,416
It's okay, son.
I gotcha.

2017
02:33:32,339 --> 02:33:33,340
I want to go home.

2018
02:33:36,260 --> 02:33:37,344
I know. I know.

2019
02:33:37,469 --> 02:33:38,387
It's okay, we're goin' home.

2020
02:33:39,096 --> 02:33:40,180
We're goin' home.

2021
02:33:43,642 --> 02:33:44,893
It's okay. It's okay.

2022
02:33:45,060 --> 02:33:46,061
Dad, I...

2023
02:33:53,151 --> 02:33:54,152
Neteyam...

2024
02:33:59,366 --> 02:34:03,370
No. No, no, no.
Neteyam!

2025
02:34:11,086 --> 02:34:12,588
Oh, Great Mother.

2026
02:34:12,754 --> 02:34:13,839
No, Great Mother.

2027
02:34:14,673 --> 02:34:16,258
<i>Please.</i>

2028
02:34:17,843 --> 02:34:19,303
Oh, my son.

2029
02:34:19,428 --> 02:34:20,929
My son.

2030
02:34:21,054 --> 02:34:22,014
No!

2031
02:34:27,936 --> 02:34:29,438
My son!

2032
02:34:32,941 --> 02:34:34,359
No!

2033
02:34:36,111 --> 02:34:37,696
No!

2034
02:34:38,363 --> 02:34:40,574
<i>Can you hear
me, Corporal?</i>

2035
02:34:42,743 --> 02:34:45,454
<i>Yeah, yeah,
I think you can.</i>

2036
02:34:46,413 --> 02:34:47,664
<i>I got your daughters.</i>

2037
02:34:50,375 --> 02:34:51,793
<i>Same deal as before.</i>

2038
02:34:53,420 --> 02:34:54,421
You for them.

2039
02:34:55,631 --> 02:34:57,382
<i>No!</i>

2040
02:34:59,760 --> 02:35:01,219
Where are your sisters?

2041
02:35:03,180 --> 02:35:04,681
Your sisters.
Where are they?

2042
02:35:05,599 --> 02:35:06,600
I don't know.

2043
02:35:06,767 --> 02:35:07,935
- Where are they?
- They're on the ship.

2044
02:35:08,101 --> 02:35:09,895
They're tied up on the ship.

2045
02:35:10,062 --> 02:35:11,271
They're at the moon pool.

2046
02:35:11,897 --> 02:35:14,024
At the well deck. Midships.

2047
02:35:14,149 --> 02:35:15,025
What?

2048
02:35:15,484 --> 02:35:16,652
Come on. I'll show you.

2049
02:35:17,277 --> 02:35:18,195
Come on.

2050
02:35:18,195 --> 02:35:18,904
I'll show you.

2051
02:35:18,904 --> 02:35:20,322
<i>Talk to me, Corporal.</i>

2052
02:35:20,489 --> 02:35:22,032
- Z, up top.
- I need somethin', Jake...

2053
02:35:22,199 --> 02:35:23,742
or there's gonna
be consequences.

2054
02:35:24,743 --> 02:35:25,744
Yeah, I hear you.

2055
02:35:26,870 --> 02:35:27,871
- Come on.
- Come on!

2056
02:35:28,038 --> 02:35:30,290
Let's go. We gotta go.
Come on, let's go.

2057
02:35:30,666 --> 02:35:32,000
- No!
- Let's go.

2058
02:35:32,167 --> 02:35:34,962
<i>Listen. Listen. Listen to me.</i>

2059
02:35:37,965 --> 02:35:38,757
Listen to me. Listen to me.

2060
02:35:38,757 --> 02:35:40,092
They have our daughters.

2061
02:35:40,259 --> 02:35:41,510
They have our daughters.

2062
02:35:44,763 --> 02:35:46,974
I need you
with me.

2063
02:35:48,183 --> 02:35:49,726
And I need you
to be strong.

2064
02:35:50,269 --> 02:35:51,687
Right now.

2065
02:35:51,853 --> 02:35:53,063
Strong heart.

2066
02:35:54,481 --> 02:35:55,732
Strong heart.

2067
02:36:09,371 --> 02:36:10,706
Let's go get our daughters.

2068
02:36:25,679 --> 02:36:27,180
You stay with your brother.

2069
02:36:27,723 --> 02:36:29,141
Dad, I want
to go with you.

2070
02:36:32,144 --> 02:36:33,145
You've done enough.

2071
02:36:33,312 --> 02:36:34,354
Dad...

2072
02:36:39,151 --> 02:36:40,152
Hold fire.

2073
02:36:41,445 --> 02:36:42,446
Let's go.

2074
02:36:43,488 --> 02:36:44,489
He's coming.

2075
02:36:46,366 --> 02:36:47,284
I'm good. Go, go!

2076
02:36:49,745 --> 02:36:50,871
Let's get
this guy.

2077
02:36:50,996 --> 02:36:52,205
It's what we
came here for.

2078
02:36:57,419 --> 02:36:58,420
Stay with him.

2079
02:36:58,962 --> 02:37:00,047
No...

2080
02:37:00,881 --> 02:37:02,215
Heads on a swivel, guys.

2081
02:37:23,612 --> 02:37:24,237
Go.

2082
02:37:32,704 --> 02:37:33,705
Where are they?

2083
02:37:33,872 --> 02:37:34,581
The middle deck.

2084
02:37:34,706 --> 02:37:35,624
Where they
launch the subs.

2085
02:37:35,791 --> 02:37:37,209
There's, like,
a pool in the center.

2086
02:37:38,168 --> 02:37:39,294
They're at the forward railing.

2087
02:37:41,880 --> 02:37:42,881
No, no.
Stay here.

2088
02:37:46,051 --> 02:37:47,219
<i>Talk to me, Corporal.</i>

2089
02:37:48,178 --> 02:37:49,263
<i>This ship's
going down...</i>

2090
02:37:49,429 --> 02:37:50,597
<i>and your girls with it.</i>

2091
02:37:52,349 --> 02:37:53,934
Your boy
didn't have to die.

2092
02:37:54,351 --> 02:37:56,019
<i>You brought
that on yourself.</i>

2093
02:38:03,193 --> 02:38:06,029
<i>You thought you could keep
your family safe, but you can't.</i>

2094
02:38:08,407 --> 02:38:10,117
<i>Only one way to keep
them safe.</i>

2095
02:38:13,996 --> 02:38:15,998
<i>So let's get this
over with before</i>

2096
02:38:16,123 --> 02:38:17,040
<i>you lose another kid.</i>

2097
02:38:28,802 --> 02:38:29,928
Get down!

2098
02:39:12,346 --> 02:39:13,430
<i>- Who's down?
- Zdinarsik, you copy?</i>

2099
02:39:13,555 --> 02:39:14,598
<i>Sound off!</i>

2100
02:39:14,765 --> 02:39:15,515
Clear!

2101
02:39:16,808 --> 02:39:18,185
Prager.
You read?

2102
02:39:20,228 --> 02:39:21,229
Eyes up.
Eyes up!

2103
02:39:30,489 --> 02:39:31,490
Move up!

2104
02:39:34,034 --> 02:39:35,035
Push left. Go!

2105
02:39:35,744 --> 02:39:36,912
Push right. Get around on her.

2106
02:39:37,371 --> 02:39:38,246
Who's got eyes?

2107
02:40:23,750 --> 02:40:24,501
<i>MaJake.</i>

2108
02:40:31,174 --> 02:40:32,301
It's Mom!

2109
02:40:38,765 --> 02:40:39,891
<i>That's right.</i>

2110
02:40:40,267 --> 02:40:42,185
They're coming for you.

2111
02:41:33,028 --> 02:41:34,029
Dad! Dad.

2112
02:41:37,407 --> 02:41:38,659
Okay.
Where's your sister?

2113
02:41:38,784 --> 02:41:39,451
Where is she?
Where is she?

2114
02:41:39,618 --> 02:41:41,078
That way.
That way.

2115
02:41:41,536 --> 02:41:42,537
Okay, stay behind me.

2116
02:41:47,834 --> 02:41:48,794
Kiri!

2117
02:41:50,045 --> 02:41:51,546
Runnin' out of time here, Corporal.

2118
02:41:53,340 --> 02:41:56,301
You already lost one kid today.
You really wanna lose another?

2119
02:41:57,177 --> 02:41:58,512
Do not test me!

2120
02:42:00,305 --> 02:42:01,765
Just kill him, Dad!

2121
02:42:04,601 --> 02:42:05,602
Weapons down.

2122
02:42:05,602 --> 02:42:06,311
Don't.

2123
02:42:06,436 --> 02:42:07,062
<i>Don't do it.</i>

2124
02:42:07,062 --> 02:42:07,980
<i>Down!</i>

2125
02:42:10,399 --> 02:42:11,400
<i>Kick 'em away.</i>

2126
02:42:13,610 --> 02:42:14,278
Do it!

2127
02:42:17,447 --> 02:42:18,490
No.

2128
02:42:20,325 --> 02:42:21,326
<i>Cuff yourself.</i>

2129
02:42:21,493 --> 02:42:22,911
No! No, don't
hurt her, okay?

2130
02:42:23,078 --> 02:42:24,079
Stand there!

2131
02:42:24,913 --> 02:42:26,498
- Don't!
- Don't move!

2132
02:42:26,498 --> 02:42:27,457
<i>Not a step.</i>

2133
02:42:28,250 --> 02:42:29,960
<i>Cuffs on. Now.</i>

2134
02:42:30,168 --> 02:42:32,212
You son
of a bitch.

2135
02:42:32,379 --> 02:42:33,880
Please, don't
hurt her.

2136
02:42:37,092 --> 02:42:38,302
Release.

2137
02:42:39,261 --> 02:42:40,262
Or I cut.

2138
02:42:42,848 --> 02:42:44,975
What, you think I
care about some kid?

2139
02:42:46,310 --> 02:42:47,311
He's not mine.

2140
02:42:48,145 --> 02:42:49,938
We're not even the same species.

2141
02:42:50,731 --> 02:42:52,232
Just please don't...

2142
02:42:52,357 --> 02:42:53,108
don't hurt her.

2143
02:42:53,275 --> 02:42:54,776
Just please
let her go.

2144
02:42:54,943 --> 02:42:55,944
- Don't.
<i>- Please!</i>

2145
02:42:56,111 --> 02:42:56,737
<i>Don't kill him.</i>

2146
02:42:56,862 --> 02:42:57,654
<i>Listen to me!</i>

2147
02:42:57,821 --> 02:42:59,281
Let her go. Don't hurt her.

2148
02:42:59,489 --> 02:43:00,949
Mom, don't kill him.

2149
02:43:01,700 --> 02:43:03,994
A son for a son.

2150
02:43:06,204 --> 02:43:07,456
<i>Please don't hurt her.</i>

2151
02:43:09,791 --> 02:43:11,001
I cut.

2152
02:43:11,168 --> 02:43:12,419
Please just let her go...

2153
02:43:12,419 --> 02:43:13,128
<i>okay?</i>

2154
02:43:13,128 --> 02:43:13,921
<i>Just let her go.</i>

2155
02:43:16,131 --> 02:43:16,965
No!

2156
02:43:26,266 --> 02:43:28,518
Kiri... Kiri.

2157
02:43:35,359 --> 02:43:36,360
Spider.

2158
02:43:37,235 --> 02:43:37,861
Spider...

2159
02:43:37,986 --> 02:43:39,071
get 'em out of here.

2160
02:43:39,529 --> 02:43:40,155
Come on.

2161
02:43:40,656 --> 02:43:41,531
Guys. Tuk.

2162
02:43:41,657 --> 02:43:43,450
I owe you
a death.

2163
02:43:45,077 --> 02:43:45,702
Mom.

2164
02:43:45,702 --> 02:43:46,703
- Mama.
- Come.

2165
02:43:46,870 --> 02:43:47,829
Come on.

2166
02:43:47,829 --> 02:43:48,705
Please...

2167
02:43:48,830 --> 02:43:49,456
Mama.

2168
02:43:49,957 --> 02:43:51,458
You're not leaving,
are you, Jake?

2169
02:43:52,250 --> 02:43:53,251
Knowin'
I'm out there.

2170
02:43:54,503 --> 02:43:56,588
Knowin' that
I'll never stop.

2171
02:43:56,964 --> 02:43:58,257
I'm coming for you.

2172
02:43:58,423 --> 02:44:01,134
And when I do, I'll
kill your whole family.

2173
02:44:02,177 --> 02:44:03,095
Dad...

2174
02:44:05,305 --> 02:44:06,223
Then let's get it done.

2175
02:44:16,984 --> 02:44:17,985
Jake!

2176
02:44:22,281 --> 02:44:23,365
- It's coming!
- Back. Back.

2177
02:44:23,532 --> 02:44:24,741
Get back to the ship. Go!

2178
02:44:24,908 --> 02:44:25,909
Tuk, swim, swim.

2179
02:44:29,079 --> 02:44:30,038
Stay close.

2180
02:44:30,289 --> 02:44:31,290
- Keep moving.
- Stay close.

2181
02:44:33,917 --> 02:44:34,543
Tuk!

2182
02:44:35,877 --> 02:44:36,753
Mom, take
my hand!

2183
02:44:36,878 --> 02:44:37,546
Hold on!

2184
02:44:40,882 --> 02:44:41,967
Mom!

2185
02:44:43,635 --> 02:44:44,511
- Kiri, come on.
- No...

2186
02:44:44,678 --> 02:44:45,554
Kiri, we've got
to go, come on.

2187
02:44:45,679 --> 02:44:46,305
No!

2188
02:44:49,558 --> 02:44:51,018
Go! Climb.
Climb!

2189
02:44:51,476 --> 02:44:52,477
Kiri,
come on!

2190
02:44:53,645 --> 02:44:54,688
Come on,
let's go!

2191
02:44:55,439 --> 02:44:56,064
Mom!

2192
02:44:56,189 --> 02:44:56,898
Swim! Swim.

2193
02:44:57,274 --> 02:44:57,941
Go, Tuk.

2194
02:44:58,066 --> 02:44:58,692
Climb up.

2195
02:45:06,408 --> 02:45:07,075
Mom...

2196
02:45:08,201 --> 02:45:09,202
Go!

2197
02:45:09,745 --> 02:45:10,746
Go, go, go!

2198
02:45:18,211 --> 02:45:19,379
Keep climbing!
Go!

2199
02:45:23,926 --> 02:45:24,927
I got you.

2200
02:45:27,262 --> 02:45:28,096
Give me your hand!

2201
02:45:28,221 --> 02:45:28,889
Come on!

2202
02:45:31,516 --> 02:45:32,309
Open it!

2203
02:45:40,984 --> 02:45:41,610
Open it!

2204
02:45:41,610 --> 02:45:42,319
Move back.

2205
02:45:42,319 --> 02:45:43,028
Move back.

2206
02:45:43,737 --> 02:45:44,738
Come.

2207
02:45:46,239 --> 02:45:46,949
Tuk!

2208
02:45:57,042 --> 02:45:57,960
Climb!

2209
02:45:58,251 --> 02:45:59,211
Go!

2210
02:46:01,463 --> 02:46:02,172
Climb!

2211
02:46:02,547 --> 02:46:03,173
Go!

2212
02:46:04,007 --> 02:46:04,800
Go up!

2213
02:46:10,597 --> 02:46:11,598
We're
rolling over!

2214
02:46:11,974 --> 02:46:12,599
Go, go,
go, go!

2215
02:46:12,599 --> 02:46:13,433
Okay...

2216
02:46:15,978 --> 02:46:17,062
No!

2217
02:46:17,521 --> 02:46:18,647
Mom!

2218
02:46:26,780 --> 02:46:27,781
Kiri!

2219
02:46:27,906 --> 02:46:28,615
Keep going!

2220
02:46:32,327 --> 02:46:33,328
This way,
this way!

2221
02:46:33,829 --> 02:46:34,496
Okay.

2222
02:46:34,663 --> 02:46:35,289
Go!

2223
02:46:39,418 --> 02:46:41,420
Open it!
Open it!

2224
02:46:43,380 --> 02:46:44,464
Mom!

2225
02:46:47,509 --> 02:46:48,510
Come on!

2226
02:46:58,061 --> 02:46:59,062
Go, Tuk!

2227
02:47:01,148 --> 02:47:02,149
There's no way out!

2228
02:47:04,443 --> 02:47:05,527
Stay together, okay?

2229
02:47:05,694 --> 02:47:07,070
- Yes.
- Stay together.

2230
02:47:07,237 --> 02:47:08,238
Yes.

2231
02:47:37,184 --> 02:47:38,393
Oh, Great
Mother!

2232
02:47:38,518 --> 02:47:39,895
Oh, Great
Mother, help us!

2233
02:48:22,729 --> 02:48:23,730
Kiri!

2234
02:48:44,293 --> 02:48:44,918
Bro!

2235
02:48:45,877 --> 02:48:46,795
Mom and Dad...

2236
02:48:46,920 --> 02:48:47,629
are down there.

2237
02:48:47,754 --> 02:48:48,380
In the ship.

2238
02:48:48,547 --> 02:48:49,590
Grab on.

2239
02:48:50,382 --> 02:48:51,383
Bro, I'm
good. Go!

2240
02:49:19,119 --> 02:49:20,120
Okay.

2241
02:49:47,940 --> 02:49:48,941
Jake!

2242
02:50:25,686 --> 02:50:26,353
Dad.

2243
02:50:31,525 --> 02:50:32,526
Fuck!

2244
02:50:47,291 --> 02:50:49,042
Come on, you son of a bitch!

2245
02:50:49,251 --> 02:50:50,168
Dad, just breathe.

2246
02:50:50,377 --> 02:50:51,211
Neteyam?

2247
02:50:52,004 --> 02:50:53,005
No, Dad.
It's Lo'ak.

2248
02:50:54,423 --> 02:50:55,424
Oh, Lo'ak.

2249
02:50:56,717 --> 02:50:57,718
I'm sorry, sir.

2250
02:50:58,218 --> 02:50:59,928
I'm sorry about Neteyam.
It's all my fault.

2251
02:51:00,137 --> 02:51:01,138
Just focus.

2252
02:51:01,263 --> 02:51:02,347
Focus on now.

2253
02:51:21,617 --> 02:51:22,743
We're losing
the air pocket.

2254
02:51:22,909 --> 02:51:23,910
Come on.
We've gotta move.

2255
02:51:24,077 --> 02:51:25,162
Come on, Dad.

2256
02:51:32,878 --> 02:51:34,421
You know your way out?

2257
02:51:34,838 --> 02:51:37,549
I think so. But, Dad,
it's gonna be a long breath-hold.

2258
02:51:37,716 --> 02:51:39,259
I can't make it.

2259
02:51:39,801 --> 02:51:41,178
You can. You can.

2260
02:51:41,303 --> 02:51:41,929
No.

2261
02:51:42,054 --> 02:51:43,096
So you gotta go right now.

2262
02:51:43,597 --> 02:51:45,140
I can't lose you
too, Dad.

2263
02:51:45,307 --> 02:51:45,974
Please.

2264
02:51:50,479 --> 02:51:52,064
Mama,
I'm scared.

2265
02:51:53,565 --> 02:51:54,566
It is all right.

2266
02:51:55,400 --> 02:51:56,443
Stay close to me.

2267
02:51:57,402 --> 02:51:58,445
Stay close to Mama.

2268
02:52:01,031 --> 02:52:02,032
It's okay.

2269
02:52:18,715 --> 02:52:20,550
You just have to
slow your heart down.

2270
02:52:21,009 --> 02:52:22,177
Be real calm.

2271
02:52:23,512 --> 02:52:24,763
Breathe
from here.

2272
02:52:24,930 --> 02:52:26,515
Hey, breathe from here.

2273
02:52:40,070 --> 02:52:41,405
The way of water has no...

2274
02:52:41,530 --> 02:52:42,823
beginning and no end.

2275
02:52:45,534 --> 02:52:47,577
The sea is around
you and in you.

2276
02:52:49,204 --> 02:52:50,414
The sea is your home...

2277
02:52:50,539 --> 02:52:52,874
before your birth
and after your death.

2278
02:52:58,088 --> 02:53:00,966
<i>The sea gives
and the sea takes.</i>

2279
02:53:02,217 --> 02:53:04,261
<i>Water connects
all things.</i>

2280
02:53:06,430 --> 02:53:07,973
Life to death.

2281
02:53:09,808 --> 02:53:12,102
Darkness to light.

2282
02:53:35,375 --> 02:53:36,209
- Hi.
- Kiri!

2283
02:53:36,376 --> 02:53:37,336
Kiri.

2284
02:53:37,502 --> 02:53:39,504
Everything's going to
be all right, little sister.

2285
02:53:39,838 --> 02:53:40,672
Mom...

2286
02:53:40,797 --> 02:53:42,174
I'm gonna
give this to you.

2287
02:53:47,220 --> 02:53:48,096
It'll help you.

2288
02:53:49,681 --> 02:53:50,641
Dad, you can do this.

2289
02:53:52,476 --> 02:53:53,685
Trust me.

2290
02:53:54,311 --> 02:53:55,270
Calm your heart.

2291
02:53:57,648 --> 02:53:58,649
Big breaths.

2292
02:54:02,653 --> 02:54:03,654
Last breath.

2293
02:54:08,700 --> 02:54:09,701
Follow me.

2294
02:55:26,028 --> 02:55:27,279
Hold on.

2295
02:55:27,404 --> 02:55:28,322
Just breathe.

2296
02:55:28,989 --> 02:55:29,823
Just breathe.

2297
02:55:34,411 --> 02:55:35,412
Thank you.

2298
02:55:44,421 --> 02:55:45,923
I See you...

2299
02:55:46,089 --> 02:55:46,882
son.

2300
02:55:49,551 --> 02:55:50,385
<i>MaJake!</i>

2301
02:55:51,803 --> 02:55:52,930
- Dad!
- Mom!

2302
02:55:53,096 --> 02:55:54,306
Dad. Dad.

2303
02:55:55,807 --> 02:55:56,475
Come on.

2304
02:55:59,019 --> 02:56:00,187
Here.

2305
02:56:06,526 --> 02:56:07,527
Brother.

2306
02:56:16,954 --> 02:56:18,872
<i>Sullys stick together.</i>

2307
02:56:21,208 --> 02:56:22,751
<i>It was our
greatest weakness...</i>

2308
02:56:24,127 --> 02:56:25,587
<i>and our
great strength.</i>

2309
02:56:27,589 --> 02:56:29,341
Thank you, Great Mother.

2310
02:56:30,050 --> 02:56:31,051
Thank you.

2311
02:57:10,382 --> 02:57:11,383
Let's move out.

2312
02:57:18,015 --> 02:57:19,016
Son.

2313
02:57:21,268 --> 02:57:22,269
Come with me.

2314
02:57:27,024 --> 02:57:28,025
Spider!

2315
02:58:02,351 --> 02:58:03,268
Monkey Boy!

2316
02:58:07,940 --> 02:58:09,149
Spider.

2317
02:58:16,490 --> 02:58:17,658
- You all right?
- Yeah.

2318
02:58:21,870 --> 02:58:22,871
Come here.

2319
02:58:25,874 --> 02:58:28,043
<i>A son for a son.</i>

2320
02:58:44,810 --> 02:58:47,062
<i>Every songcord must have a last bead.</i>

2321
02:59:12,254 --> 02:59:14,089
<i>A father protects.</i>

2322
02:59:15,424 --> 02:59:16,925
<i>It's what gives him meaning.</i>

2323
02:59:45,287 --> 02:59:47,748
<i>The People say that
all energy is only borrowed.</i>

2324
02:59:50,584 --> 02:59:52,461
<i>And one day you
have to give it back.</i>

2325
03:00:06,308 --> 03:00:07,976
<i>Eywa holds...</i>

2326
03:00:08,185 --> 03:00:09,603
<i>all her children in her heart.</i>

2327
03:00:11,563 --> 03:00:12,856
<i>Nothing is ever lost.</i>

2328
03:00:16,193 --> 03:00:17,194
Neteyam!

2329
03:00:17,819 --> 03:00:19,029
<i>Neteyam!</i>

2330
03:00:39,091 --> 03:00:40,342
My family and I...

2331
03:00:41,468 --> 03:00:42,511
we'll move on tomorrow.

2332
03:00:43,262 --> 03:00:44,388
Far away from here.

2333
03:00:45,806 --> 03:00:47,516
Your son lies
with our ancestors.

2334
03:00:48,809 --> 03:00:51,478
You are
<i>Metkayina</i> now.

2335
03:00:57,192 --> 03:00:58,610
<i>And there it was.</i>

2336
03:01:00,612 --> 03:01:02,030
<i>We are Sea People now.</i>

2337
03:01:04,574 --> 03:01:06,493
<i>This is our home.</i>

2338
03:02:07,054 --> 03:02:08,055
Dad!

2339
03:02:08,931 --> 03:02:09,932
Look what
I caught!

2340
03:02:10,724 --> 03:02:11,725
Wow.

2341
03:02:13,018 --> 03:02:14,061
Oh, that's a big one.

2342
03:02:14,728 --> 03:02:16,396
He was in that pool.

2343
03:02:16,521 --> 03:02:17,147
By the rocks.

2344
03:02:19,358 --> 03:02:20,609
Right where
you said.

2345
03:02:24,488 --> 03:02:25,614
<i>What is it, Dad?</i>

2346
03:02:27,157 --> 03:02:28,158
Why are
you crying?

2347
03:02:30,452 --> 03:02:33,038
I'm just happy
to see you, boy.

2348
03:02:34,665 --> 03:02:35,999
I'm happy to
see you, too.

2349
03:02:38,752 --> 03:02:39,378
Here.

2350
03:02:39,503 --> 03:02:40,254
You try.

2351
03:02:42,756 --> 03:02:43,757
Okay.

2352
03:02:45,509 --> 03:02:46,843
Leave any for me?

2353
03:02:47,010 --> 03:02:48,011
Maybe.

2354
03:02:54,685 --> 03:02:56,436
<i>Yeah! Check that out. See?</i>

2355
03:03:04,069 --> 03:03:05,362
<i>I see now.</i>

2356
03:03:06,321 --> 03:03:08,323
<i>I can't save my
family by running.</i>

2357
03:03:09,491 --> 03:03:10,534
<i>This is
our home.</i>

2358
03:03:11,535 --> 03:03:13,120
<i>This is
our fortress.</i>

2359
03:03:14,496 --> 03:03:16,581
<i>This is where we
make our stand.</i>
