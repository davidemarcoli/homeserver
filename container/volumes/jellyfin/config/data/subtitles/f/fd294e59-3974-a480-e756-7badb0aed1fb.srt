1
01:01:16,791 --> 01:01:18,333
I'm not going to hurt you.

2
01:01:22,541 --> 01:01:25,583
You're far from home and so am I.

3
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:28,875
You and I…

4
01:01:30,166 --> 01:01:31,333
…we are alike.

5
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:35,000
We've been hurt…

6
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:37,458
…betrayed…our trust has been broken.

7
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:46,666
We both know fear.

8
01:01:47,416 --> 01:01:49,166
Yet, the biggest fear we both face…

9
01:01:58,375 --> 01:02:00,875
…is the fear of ourselves.

10
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:12,666
Let's show them we're not afraid.

11
01:02:13,291 --> 01:02:18,250
Let's show them we're more
than the shackles that bind us.

12
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,791
Your patience is appreciated
and I can assure you…

13
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:38,375
…Devra is aware of your presence.

14
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:44,875
A decision
when to receive you is imminent.

15
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:51,041
Thank you, Levitica, honored King.

16
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:57,291
We await their arrival.

17
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:31,875
I beg you…
